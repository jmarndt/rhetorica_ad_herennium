	<p class="start small kaput justify">
	<a class="chapter" name="R34">[34]</a>
<a class="sec" name="46">[46]</a>&nbsp;This is substantially all 
I&nbsp;have thought it necessary to say on the Figures of Diction. Now 
the subject itself directs me to turn next to the Figures of Thought.

<a class="sec" name="47">47</a>&nbsp;Distribution​<a class="ref" id="ref1" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/4C*.html#note1" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">1</a> occurs when certain specified rôles are assigned among a&nbsp;number of things or persons,​<a class="ref" id="ref2" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/4C*.html#note2" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">2</a>
 as follows: "Whoever of you, men of the jury, loves the good name of 
the Senate, must hate this man, for his attacks upon that body have 
always been most insolent. Whoever of you wishes the equestrian order​<a class="ref" id="ref3" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/4C*.html#note3" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">3</a>
 to be most resplendent in the state, must want this person to have paid
 the severest penalty, so that he may not be, through his personal 
shame, a stain and disgrace to a most honourable order. You who have 
parents, must prove by your punishment of this creature that un­<span class="whole">dutiful</span>
 men do not find favour with you. You who have children, must set forth 
an example to show how great are the punishments that have been provided
 in our state for men of that stamp." Again, "The Senate's function is 
to assist the state with counsel; the magistracy's is to execute, by 
diligent activity, the Senate's will; the people's to choose and support
 by its votes the best measures and the most suitable men." Again, "The 
duty of the prosecutor is to bring the charges; that of the counsel for 
the defence to explain them away and rebut them; that


<a id="p349"><span class="pagenum">&nbsp;p349&nbsp;</span></a>of the witness to say what he knows or has heard;​<a class="ref" id="ref4" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/4C*.html#note4" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">4</a>
 that of the presiding justice to hold each of these to his duty. 
Therefore, Lucius Cassius, if you allow a witness to argue and to attack
 by means of conjecture, passing beyond what he knows or has heard, you 
will be confusing the rights of a prosecutor with those of a witness, 
you will be encouraging the partiality of a dishonest witness, and you 
will be ordaining for the defendant that he defend himself twice."​<a class="ref" id="ref5" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/4C*.html#note5" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">5</a>
 This figure has richness, for it embraces much in little and, by 
assigning to each his duty, severally distinguishes a&nbsp;number of 
entities.

	</p><p class="justify">
	<a class="chapter" name="R36">36</a>
	<a id="frankness_of_speech"></a>
<a class="sec" name="48">48</a>&nbsp;It is Frankness of Speech​<a class="ref" id="ref6" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/4C*.html#note6" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">6</a>
 when, talking before those to whom we owe reverence or fear, we yet 
exercise our right to speak out, because we seem justified in 
reprehending them, or persons dear to them, for some fault. For example:
 "You wonder, fellow citizens, that every one abandons your interests? 
That no one undertakes your cause? That no one declares himself your 
defender? Blame this upon yourselves; cease to wonder. Why indeed should
 not every one avoid and shun this situation of your making? Bethink 
yourselves of those whom you have had for defenders; set their devotion 
before your eyes, and next consider what has become of them all. Then 
remember that thanks to your — to speak aright — indifference, or 
cowardice rather, all these men have been murdered before your eyes, and


<a id="p351"><span class="pagenum">&nbsp;p351&nbsp;</span></a>thanks to your own votes their enemies have reached the highest estate."​<a class="ref" id="ref7" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/4C*.html#note7" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">7</a>
 Again: "Now what was your motive, men of the jury, in hesitating to 
pass sentence on this abominable man, or in allowing him a new trial?​<a class="ref" id="ref8" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/4C*.html#note8" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">8</a>
 Were not the facts charged as plain as day? Were they not all proved by
 witnesses? Was not the answer, on the other hand, feeble and trifling? 
Did you at this point fear that in condemning him at the first hearing 
you would be considered cruel? While avoiding a reproach for cruelty, 
which you would have been far from incurring, you have incurred another 
reproach — you are considered timid and cowardly. You have met with very
 great losses, private and public, and now when even greater losses seem
 to impend, you sit and yawn. During the day you wait for night, at 
night you wait for day. Every day some troublesome and unpleasant news 
is announced — yet even now will you temporize longer with the author of
 these our ills, and nourish him for the destruction of the republic; 
will you keep him in the commonwealth as long as you can?"

	</p><p class="justify">
	<a class="chapter" name="R37">37</a>
<a class="sec" name="49">49</a>&nbsp;If Frank Speech of this sort seems 
too pungent, there will be many means of palliation, for one may 
immediately thereafter add something of this sort: "I&nbsp;here appeal 
to your virtue, I&nbsp;call on your wisdom, I&nbsp;bespeak your old 
habit," so that praise may quiet the feelings aroused by the frankness. 
As a result, the praise frees the hearer from wrath and annoyance, and 
the frankness deters him from error. This precaution in speaking, as in


<a id="p353"><span class="pagenum">&nbsp;p353&nbsp;</span></a>friendship,
 if taken at the right place, is especially effective in keeping the 
hearers from error and in presenting us, the speakers, as friendly both 
to the hearers and to the truth.

	</p><p class="justify">
There is also a certain kind of frankness in speaking which is achieved 
by a craftier device, when we remonstrate with the hearers as they wish 
us to remonstrate with them, or when we say "we fear how the audience 
may think" something which we know they all will hear with acceptance, 
"yet the truth moves us to say it none the less."​<a class="ref" id="ref9" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/4C*.html#note9" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">9</a>
 I&nbsp;shall add examples of both these kinds. Of the former, as 
follows: "Fellow citizens, you are of too simple and gentle a character;
 you have too much confidence in every one. You think that every one 
strives to perform what he has promised you. You are mistaken, and now 
for a long time you have been kept back by false and groundless hope, in
 your fatuity choosing to seek from others what lay in your power, 
rather than take it yourselves."​<a class="ref" id="ref10" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/4C*.html#note10" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">10</a>
 Of the latter kind of Frank Speech the following will be an example: 
"I&nbsp;enjoyed a friendship with this person, men of the jury, yet of 
that friendship — although I&nbsp;fear how you are going to receive what
 I&nbsp;shall say, I&nbsp;will yet say it — you have deprived me. Why? 
Because, in order to win your approval, I&nbsp;have preferred to 
consider your assailant as an enemy rather than as a friend."

	</p><p class="justify" id="p355"><span class="pagenum">&nbsp;p355&nbsp;</span>
<a class="sec" name="50">50</a>&nbsp;Thus this figure called Frankness 
of Speech will, as I&nbsp;have shown, be handled in two ways: with 
pungency, which, if too severe, will be mitigated by praise; and with 
reticence, discussed above, which does not require mitigation, because 
it assumes the guise of Frank Speech and is of itself agreeable to the 
hearer's frame of mind.

	</p><p class="justify">
	<a class="chapter" name="R38">38</a>
Understatement​<a class="ref" id="ref11" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/4C*.html#note11" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">11</a>
 occurs when we say that by nature, fortune, or diligence, we or our 
clients possess some exceptional advantage, and, in order to avoid the 
impression of arrogant display, we moderate and soften the statement of 
it, as follows: "This, men of the jury, I&nbsp;have the right to say — 
that, by labour and diligence I&nbsp;have contrived to be no laggard in 
the mastery of military science." If the speaker had here said "be the 
best" he might have spoken the truth, but would have seemed arrogant. He
 has now said quite enough both to avoid envy and to secure praise. 
Again: "Was it then because of avarice or of need that he entered upon 
the crime? Avarice? But he was most generous to his friends, and that is
 a sign of generosity, a virtue opposed to avarice. Need? But his father
 left him a patrimony that was — I&nbsp;do not wish to exaggerate — not 
the smallest."​<a class="ref" id="ref12" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/4C*.html#note12" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">12</a>
 Here again, calling the patrimony "large" or "very large" was avoided. 
This, then, is the precaution we shall take in setting forth the 
exceptional advantages which we or our clients enjoy. For


<a id="p357"><span class="pagenum">&nbsp;p357&nbsp;</span></a>things of 
this sort, if you handle them indiscreetly, in life provoke jealousy and
 in a speech antipathy. Therefore just as by circumspection we escape 
jealousy in life, so by prudence we avoid antipathy in speaking.

	</p><p class="justify">
	<a class="chapter" name="R39">39</a>
<a class="sec" name="51">51</a>&nbsp;Vivid Description​<a class="ref" id="ref13" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/4C*.html#note13" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">13</a>
 is the name for the figure which contains a clear, lucid, and 
impressive exposition of the consequences of an act, as follows: "But, 
men of the jury, if by your votes you free this defendant, immediately, 
like a lion released from his cage, or some foul beast loosed from his 
chains,​<a class="ref" id="ref14" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/4C*.html#note14" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">14</a> he will slink and prowl about in the forum,​<a class="ref" id="ref15" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/4C*.html#note15" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">15</a>
 sharpening his teeth to attack every one's property, assaulting every 
man, friend and enemy, known to him or unknown, now despoiling a good 
name, now attacking a life, now bringing ruin upon a house and its 
entire household, shaking the republic from its foundations. Therefore, 
men of the jury, cast him out from the state, free every one from fear, 
and finally, think of yourselves. For if you release this creature 
without punishment, believe me, gentlemen, it is against yourselves that
 you will have let loose a wild and savage beast."

	</p><p class="justify">
Again: "For if you inflict a heavy penalty upon the defendant, men of 
the jury, you will at once by a single judgement have taken many lives. 
His aged father, who has set the entire hope of his last years on this 
young man, will have no reason for wishing to stay alive. His small 
children, deprived of their father's aid, will be exposed as objects of 
scorn and contempt to their father's enemies. His entire household will 
collapse under this undeserved


<a id="p359"><span class="pagenum">&nbsp;p359&nbsp;</span></a>calamity. 
But his enemies, when once they have won the bloody palm by the most 
cruel of victories, will exult over the miseries of these unfortunates, 
and will be found insolent on the score of deeds as well as of words."

	</p><p class="justify">
Again: "For none of you, fellow citizens, fails to see what miseries 
usually follow upon the capture of a city. Those who have borne arms 
against the victors are forthwith slain with extreme cruelty. Of the 
rest, those who by reason of youth and strength can endure hard labour 
are carried off into slavery, and those who cannot are deprived of life.
 In short, at one and the same time a house blazes up by the enemy's 
torch, and they whom nature or free choice has joined in the bonds of 
kinship or of sympathy are dragged apart. Of the children, some are torn
 from their parents' arms, others murdered on their parents' bosom, 
still others violated at their parents' feet. No one, men of the jury, 
can, by words, do justice to the deed, nor reproduce in language the 
magnitude of the disaster."<a class="ref" id="ref16" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/4C*.html#note16" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">16</a>

	</p><p class="justify">
With this kind of figure either indignation or pity can be aroused, when
 the consequences of an act, taken together as a whole, are concisely 
set forth in a clear style.

	</p><p class="justify" id="p361"><span class="pagenum">&nbsp;p361&nbsp;</span>

<a class="sec" name="52">52</a>&nbsp;Division​<a class="ref" id="ref17" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/4C*.html#note17" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">17</a>
 separates the alternatives of a question and resolves each by means of a
 reason subjoined, as follows: "Why should&nbsp;I now reproach you in 
any way? If you are an upright man, you have not deserved reproach; if a
 wicked man, you will be unmoved." Again: "Why should&nbsp;I now boast 
of my deserts? If you remember them, I&nbsp;shall weary you; if you have
 forgotten them, have been ineffective in action, and therefore what 
could&nbsp;I effect by words?" Again: "There are two things which can 
urge men to illicit gain: poverty and greed. That you were greedy in the
 division with your brother we know, that you are poor and destitute we 
now see. How, therefore, can you show that you had no motive for the 
crime?" There is the following difference between the present kind of 
Division and that other which forms the third part of a discourse, and 
which I&nbsp;treated in Book&nbsp;I,​<a class="ref" id="ref18" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/4C*.html#note18" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">18</a>
 next after Statement of Facts: the former Division operates through the
 Enumeration or Exposition of the topics to be discussed throughout the 
whole discourse; whereas here the Division at once unfolds itself, and 
by briefly adding the reasons for the two or more parts, embellishes the
 style.

	</p><p class="justify">
Accumulation​<a class="ref" id="ref19" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/4C*.html#note19" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">19</a>
 occurs when the points scattered throughout the whole cause are 
collected in one place so as to make the speech more impressive or sharp
 or accusatory, as follows: "From what vice, I&nbsp;ask, is this 
defendant free? What ground have you for wishing to acquit him of the 
suit? He is the betrayer of his own <span class="whole">self-respect</span>, and the waylayer of


<a id="p363"><span class="pagenum">&nbsp;p363&nbsp;</span></a>the <span class="whole">self-respect</span> of others; covetous, intemperate<span class="emend">,</span> irascible, arrogant; disloyal to his parents, ungrateful to his friends, troublesome to his kin; insulting to his betters, <span class="whole">disdain</span>­ful of his equals and mates, cruel to his inferiors; in short he is intolerable to every one."

	</p><p class="justify">
<a class="sec" name="53">53</a>&nbsp;Of the same kind is that other 
Accumulation, which is very useful in city council cases, when the

"If the defendant profited from the victim's death; if also his life is

very meagre; and if that crime benefited no one but him;​<a class="ref" id="ref22" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/4C*.html#note22" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">22</a>

himself could not have done it by methods more apt; if he neglected 
nothing that was necessary for the crime, and did nothing that was not 
necessary; and if he not only sought the most suitable place, but also a
 favourable occasion for entering upon the crime, and the most opportune
 moment for undertaking it; if he spent the longest period of time in 
executing it, and not without the greatest hope of concealing and 
completing it; and besides, if, before the victim was murdered, the 
defendant was seen, alone, in the place in which the murder was 
committed; if soon afterward, during the very


<a id="p365"><span class="pagenum">&nbsp;p365&nbsp;</span></a>commission
 of the crime, the voice of the victim was heard; if it is established 
that then, after the murder, the defendant returned home, at dead of

inconsistently​<a class="ref" id="ref23" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/4C*.html#note23" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">23</a> — if all these indications are proved, partly by witnesses, and partly by the confessions upon torture​<a class="ref" id="ref24" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/4C*.html#note24" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">24</a>
 which have been adduced in confirmation, and by public opinion, which, 
born of evidence, must necessarily be true; then, gentlemen, it is your 
duty to gather all these indications into one, and arrive at definite 
knowledge, not suspicion, of the crime. To be sure, some one or two of 
these things can by chance have happened in such a way as to throw 
suspicion upon this defendant; but for everything to coincide from first
 to last, he must have been a participant in the crime. This cannot be 
the result of chance." This figure has force, and in a city council 
issue is almost always essential; in the other types of causes and 
indeed in all discourse it is to be used occasionally.

 consists in dwelling on the same topic and yet seeming to say something
 ever new. It is accomplished in two ways: by merely repeating the same 
idea, or by descanting upon it. We shall not repeat the same thing 
precisely — for that, to be sure, would weary the hearer and not refine 
the idea — but with changes. Our changes will be of three kinds: in the 
words, in the delivery, and in the treatment.

	</p><p class="justify">
Our changes will be verbal when, having expressed the idea once, we repeat it once again or oftener in


<a id="p367"><span class="pagenum">&nbsp;p367&nbsp;</span></a>other, 
equivalent terms, as follows: "No peril is so great that a wise man 
would think it ought to be avoided when the safety of the fatherland is 
at stake. When the lasting security of the state is in question, the man
 endowed with good principles will undoubtedly believe that in defence 
of the fortunes of the republic he ought to shun no crisis of life, and 
he will ever persist in the determination eagerly to enter, for the 
fatherland, any combat, however great the peril to life."

	</p><p class="justify">
Our changes will reside in the delivery if now in the tone of 
conversation, now in an energetic tone, and now in variation after 
variation of voice and gesture, repeating the same ideas in different 
words, we also change the delivery quite strikingly. This cannot be 
described with complete effectiveness, and yet it is clear enough. Hence
 there is no need of illustration.

	</p><p class="justify">
<a class="sec" name="55">55</a>&nbsp;The third kind of change, 
accomplished in the treatment, will take place if we transfer the 
thought into the form of Dialogue or into the form of Arousal.

	</p><p class="justify">
	<a class="chapter" name="R43">43</a>
Dialogue — which I&nbsp;shall soon more fully discuss in its place​<a class="ref" id="ref26" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/4C*.html#note26" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">26</a>
 and shall now touch upon briefly, as far as may be sufficient for the 
present purpose — consists in putting in the mouth of some person 
language in keeping with his character, as follows (for the sake of 
greater clarity, to continue the same theme as above): "The wise man 
will think that for the common weal he ought to undergo every peril.​<a class="ref" id="ref27" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/4C*.html#note27" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">27</a> Often he will say to himself:​<a class="ref" id="ref28" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/4C*.html#note28" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">28</a> 'Not for self alone was&nbsp;I born, but also, and much more, for the fatherland.<a class="ref" id="ref29" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/4C*.html#note29" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">29</a>


<a id="p369"><span class="pagenum">&nbsp;p369&nbsp;</span></a>Above all,
 let me spend my life, which I&nbsp;owe to fate, for the salvation of my
 country. She has nourished me. She has in safety and honour reared me 
even to this time of life. She has protected my interests by good laws, 
the best of customs, and a most honourable training. How can&nbsp;I 
adequately repay her from whom I&nbsp;have received these blessings?' 
According as the wise man often says this to himself, when the republic 
is in danger, he on his part will shun no danger."

	</p><p class="justify">
Again, the idea is changed in the treatment by means of a transfer to the form of Arousal,​<a class="ref" id="ref30" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/4C*.html#note30" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">30</a>
 when not only we ourselves seem to speak under emotion, but we also 
stir the hearer, thus: "Who is possessed of reasoning power so feeble, 
whose soul is bound in such straits of envy, that he would not heap 
eager praise upon this man and judge him most wise, a man who for the 
salvation of the fatherland, the security of the state, and the 
prosperity of the republic eagerly undertakes and gladly undergoes any 
danger, no matter how great or terrible? <a class="sec" name="56">56</a>&nbsp;For
 my part, my desire to praise this man adequately is greater than my 
power to do so, and I&nbsp;am sure that this feeling of inadequacy is 
shared by all of you."

	</p><p class="justify">
The theme, then, will be varied in speaking in these three ways: in the 
words, in the delivery, in the treatment. In the treatment we shall vary
 the theme by two means: by Dialogue and by Arousal.

	</p><p class="justify">
But when we descant upon the same theme, we shall use a great many 
variations. Indeed, after having expressed the theme simply, we can 
subjoin the Reason, and then express the theme in another form, with or 
without the Reasons;​<a class="ref" id="ref31" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/4C*.html#note31" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">31</a> next we can present the Contrary​<a class="ref" id="ref32" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/4C*.html#note32" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">32</a> (all this I&nbsp;have discussed under


<a id="p371"><span class="pagenum">&nbsp;p371&nbsp;</span></a>Figures of Diction); then a Comparison and an Example (about these I&nbsp;shall say more in their place);​<a class="ref" id="ref33" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/4C*.html#note33" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">33</a> <a class="chapter" name="R44">44</a>&nbsp;and finally the Conclusion (the essential details of which were discussed in Book&nbsp;II,​<a class="ref" id="ref34" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/4C*.html#note34" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">34</a> when I&nbsp;showed how one should bring arguments to a close; in this Book​<a class="ref" id="ref35" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/4C*.html#note35" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">35</a>
 I&nbsp;have explained the nature of that figure of diction which is 
called Conclusion). A&nbsp;Refinement of this sort, which will consist 
of numerous figures of diction and of thought, can therefore be 
exceedingly ornate.

The following, then, will illustrate a treatment in seven parts — to 
continue the use of the same theme for my example, in order that you may
 know how easily, by the precepts of rhetoric, a simple idea is 
developed in a multiple manner:​<a class="ref" id="ref36" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/4C*.html#note36" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">36</a>

 because it may often happen that if a man has been loath to perish for 
his country it will be necessary for him to perish with her. Further,

<a class="sec" name="58">58</a>&nbsp;It is of these types, then, that 
Refining consists. I&nbsp;have been led to discuss it at rather great 
length because it not only gives force and distinction to the speech 
when we plead a cause, but it is by far our most important means of 
training for skill in style. It will be advantageous therefore to 
practise the principles of Refining in exercises divorced from a real 
cause, and in actual pleading to put them to use in the Embellishment of
 an argument, which I&nbsp;discussed in Book&nbsp;II.<a class="ref" id="ref47" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/4C*.html#note47" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">47</a>

 occurs when one remains rather long upon, and often returns to, the 
strongest topic on which the whole cause rests. Its use is particularly 
advantageous, and is especially characteristic of the good orator, for 
no opportunity is given the hearer to remove his attention from this 
strongest topic. I&nbsp;have been unable to subjoin a quite appropriate 
example​<a class="ref" id="ref49" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/4C*.html#note49" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">49</a> of the figure, because this topic is not isolated from the whole cause like some limb, but like blood​<a class="ref" id="ref50" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/4C*.html#note50" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">50</a> is spread through the whole body of the discourse.

Through Antithesis contraries will meet. As I&nbsp;have explained above, it belongs either among the figures of diction,​<a class="ref" id="ref51" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/4C*.html#note51" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">51</a>
 as in the following example: "You show yourself conciliatory to your 
enemies, inexorable to your friends"; or among the figures of thought, 
as in the following example: "While you deplore the troubles besetting 
him, this knave rejoices in the ruin of the state. While you despair of 
your fortunes, this knave alone grows all the more confident in his 
own." Between these two kinds of Antithesis there is this difference: 
the first consists in a rapid opposition of words; in the other opposing
 thoughts ought to meet in a comparison.

	</p><p class="justify">
<a class="sec" name="59">59</a>&nbsp;Comparison​<a class="ref" id="ref52" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/4C*.html#note52" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">52</a>
 is a manner of speech that carries over an element of likeness from one
 thing to a different thing. This is used to embellish or prove or 
clarify or vilify. Furthermore, corresponding to these four aims, it has
 four forms of presentation: Contrast, Negation, Detailed Parallel, 
Abridged Comparison. To each single aim in the use of Comparison we 
shall adapt the corresponding form of presentation.

	</p><p class="justify" id="Comparison_by_contrast">
	<a class="chapter" name="R46">46</a>
In the form of a contrast, in order to embellish, Comparison is used as 
follows: "Unlike what happens in the palaestra, where he who receives 
the flaming torch is swifter in the relay race than he who hands it on, 
the new general who receives command of an army is not superior to the 
general who retires from its command. For in the one case it is an 
exhausted runner who hands the torch to a fresh athlete, whereas in this
 it is an experienced commander who hands over the army to an 
inexperienced." This could have been expressed quite


<a id="p379"><span class="pagenum">&nbsp;p379&nbsp;</span></a>simply, 
clearly, and plausibly without the Comparison, as follows: "They say 
that usually it is inferior generals who take over the command of armies
 from superior." But the Comparison is used for embellishment, so as to 
secure a certain distinction for the style. It is moreover presented in 
the form of a contrast. For a Comparison in the form of a contrast is 
used when we deny that something else is like the thing we are asserting
 to be true.

	</p><p class="justify" id="Comparison_by_negation">
In the form of a negation and for the purpose of proof, Comparison will 
be used as follows: "Neither can an untrained horse, however well-built 
by nature, be fit for the services desired of a horse, nor can an 
uncultivated man, however <span class="whole">well-endowed</span> by nature, attain to virtue."​<a class="ref" id="ref53" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/4C*.html#note53" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">53</a>
 This idea has been rendered more plausible, for it becomes easier to 
believe that virtue cannot be secured without culture, when we see that 
not even a horse can be serviceable if untrained. Thus the Comparison is
 used for the purpose of proof, and moreover is presented in the form of
 a negation, as is clear from the first word of the Comparison.

	</p><p class="justify" id="Comparison_for_clarity">
	<a class="chapter" name="R47">47</a>
<a class="sec" name="60">60</a>&nbsp;A&nbsp;comparison will be used also
 for greater clarity — the presentation being in abridged form — as 
follows: "In maintaining a friendship, as in a&nbsp;foot-race, you must 
train yourself not only so that you succeed in running as far as is 
required, but so that, extending yourself by will and sinew, you easily 
run beyond that point." Indeed this Comparison serves to make more 
obvious the poor reasoning evinced by the detractors of those who, for 
example, are


<a id="p381"><span class="pagenum">&nbsp;p381&nbsp;</span></a>protectors
 of a friend's children after his death; for a runner ought to have 
enough speed to carry him beyond the goal, and a friend so much good 
will that in the devotion of friendship he may reach even beyond what 
his friend is capable of perceiving. The Comparison is moreover 
presented in abridged form, for one term is not detached from the other 
as in the other form, but the two are conjoined and intermingled in the 
presentation.

	</p><p class="justify" id="Comparison_for_vividness">
A&nbsp;Comparison will be used for vividness, and be set forth in the form of a detailed parallel,​<a class="ref" id="ref54" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/4C*.html#note54" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">54</a> as follows: "Let us imagine a player on the lyre​<a class="ref" id="ref55" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/4C*.html#note55" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">55</a> who has presented himself on the stage, magnificently garbed, clothed in a <span class="whole">gold-embroidered</span>
 robe, with purple mantle interlaced in various colours, wearing a 
golden crown illumined with large gleaming jewels, and holding a lyre 
covered with golden ornaments and set off with ivory. Further, he has a 
personal beauty, presence, and stature that impose dignity. If, when by 
these means he has roused a great expectation in the public, he should 
in the silence he has created suddenly give utterance to a rasping 
voice, and this should be accompanied by a repulsive gesture, he is the 
more forcibly thrust off in derision and scorn, the richer his adornment
 and the higher the hopes he has raised. In the same way, a man of high 
station, endowed with great and opulent resources, and abounding in all 
the gifts of fortune and the emoluments of nature, if he yet lacks 
virtue and the arts that teach virtue, will so much the more forcibly in
 derision and scorn be cast from all association with good men, the 
richer he is in the other advantages, the greater his distinction, and 
the higher the hopes he has raised." This Comparison, by embellishing 
both


<a id="p383"><span class="pagenum">&nbsp;p383&nbsp;</span></a>terms, 
bringing into relation by a method of parallel description the one man's
 ineptitude and the other's lack of cultivation, has set the subject 
vividly before the eyes of all. Moreover the Comparison is presented in 
the form of a detailed parallel because, once the similitude has been 
set up, all like elements are related.

	</p><p class="justify">
	<a class="chapter" name="R48">48</a>
<a class="sec" name="61">61</a>&nbsp;In Comparisons we must carefully 
see to it that when we present the corresponding idea for the sake of 
which we have introduced the figure we use words suited to the likeness.
 The following is an example: "Just as when the swallows are with us in 
summer time, and when driven by the frost retire,&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;." 
Keeping the same comparison, and using Metaphor, we now say: "so false 
friends are with us in a peaceful season of our life, and as soon as 
they have seen the winter of our fortune, they fly away, one and all." 
But the invention of Comparisons will be easy if one can frequently set 
before one's eyes everything animate and inanimate, mute and articulate,
 wild and tame, of the earth, sky, and sea, wrought by art, chance, or 
nature, ordinary or unusual, and can amongst these hunt out some 
likeness which is capable of embellishing or proving or clarifying or 
vivifying. The resemblance between the two things need not apply 
throughout, but must hold on the precise point of comparison.

character, says: 'You had better send more slaves over there if you want
 the counting done today.' 'Go then,' he

As if in fact he knew the owner, the rascal now enters the house with 
his guest. 'Here,' says he, 'is where I&nbsp;live.' He scrutinizes the 
silver which had been laid out, inspects the <span class="whole">dining-couch</span>

boy comes up. They say aloud to the man that the master is about to

 he had, to the prejudice of his health, waited for them late into the 
night. To his boy Sannio he had given the job of borrowing vessels, 
coverings, and servants, and the little slave, not wanting in 
cleverness, had quite energetically and artfully procured all these. The
 rascal leads his guest to his home. He says he has accommodated one of 
his friends with the loan of his largest mansion for a wedding. The boy 
reports that the silver is being recalled; the lender had misgivings. 
'Off with you,' says our man, 'I&nbsp;have obliged him with a mansion,

<a class="sec" name="65">65</a>&nbsp;Character Delineations of this kind

 when a word can be taken in two or more senses, but yet is taken in

 as follows: As soon as Gracchus saw that the people were wavering, in 
their fear that he might, by the Senate's decree, be moved to change his
 mind, he ordered a convocation of the Assembly. In the meanwhile, this 
fellow, filled with wicked and criminal designs, bounds out of the 
temple of Jupiter. In a sweat, with eyes blazing,​<a class="ref" id="ref100" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/4C*.html#note100" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">100</a>
 hair bristling, toga awry, he begins to quicken his pace, several other
 men joining him. While the herald is asking attention for Gracchus, the
 fellow, beside himself, plants his heel on a bench, breaks off a leg of
 it with his right hand, and orders the others to do likewise. When 
Gracchus begins a prayer to the gods, these creatures in a rush attack 
him, coming together from all quarters, and a man in the crowd shouts: 
'Fly, Tiberius, fly! Don't you see? Look behind you, I&nbsp;say!' Then 
the <span class="whole">fickle</span> mob, stricken with sudden fear, 
take to flight. But this fellow, frothing crime from his mouth, 
breathing forth cruelty from the depth of his lungs, swings his arm, 
and, while Gracchus wonders what it means, but still does not move from 
the place where he stood, strikes him on the temple. Gracchus does not 
impair his inborn manliness by a single cry, but falls without uttering a
 sound. The assassin, bespattered with the pitiable blood of the bravest
 of heroes, looks about him as if he had done a most admirable deed, 
gaily extends his murderous hand to his

Thayer's Note: At last, after having transcribed this entire work by 
hand, and its 765&nbsp;notes, and out of excess of masochism, proofread

querulous little bleat of mine, you should actually happen to have found
 the exercise useful,
