	<h1>
	<a id="p157"><span class="pagenum">&nbsp;p157&nbsp;</span></a>
Book&nbsp;III
	</h1>


	<p class="start justify">
	<a class="chapter" name="R1">1</a>
<a class="sec" name="1">1</a>&nbsp;In the preceding Books I&nbsp;have, 
as I&nbsp;believe, shown amply enough how to apply the Invention of 
topics to any judicial cause. The method of finding causes I&nbsp;now 
carry over to the present Book,​<a class="ref" id="ref1" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/3*.html#note1" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">1</a> in order that I&nbsp;may as speedily as possible discharge my task of explaining to you all the rules of Invention.

	</p><p class="justify">
Four departments of rhetoric are left us to consider. Three are treated in the present Book: Arrangement,​<a class="ref" id="ref2" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/3*.html#note2" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">2</a> Delivery,​<a class="ref" id="ref3" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/3*.html#note3" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">3</a> and Memory.​<a class="ref" id="ref4" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/3*.html#note4" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">4</a> Style, because it seems to require a fuller treatment, I&nbsp;prefer to discuss in Book&nbsp;IV,​<a class="ref" id="ref5" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/3*.html#note5" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">5</a>
 which I&nbsp;hope to complete quickly and send to you, so that you may 
not lack anything on the art of rhetoric. Meanwhile you will learn all 
the principles I&nbsp;first set forth,​<a class="ref" id="ref6" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/3*.html#note6" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">6</a>
 with me, when you wish, and at times without me, by reading, so that 
you may in no way be kept from equal progress with me towards the 
mastery of this useful art. It is now for you to give attention, while 
I&nbsp;resume progress towards our goal.

	</p><p class="justify">

<a class="sec" name="2">2</a>&nbsp;Deliberative​<a class="ref" id="ref7" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/3*.html#note7" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">7</a>
 speeches are either of the kind in which the question concerns a choice
 between two courses of action, or of the kind in which a choice among 
several is considered. An example of a


<a id="p159"><span class="pagenum">&nbsp;p159&nbsp;</span></a>choice between two courses of action: Does it seem better to destroy Carthage, or to leave her standing?​<a class="ref" id="ref8" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/3*.html#note8" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">8</a>
 An example of a choice among several: If Hannibal, when recalled to 
Carthage from Italy, should deliberate whether to remain in Italy, or 
return home, or invade Egypt and seize Alexandria.<a class="ref" id="ref9" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/3*.html#note9" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">9</a>

	</p><p class="justify">
Again, a question under deliberation is sometimes to be examined on its 
own account; for example, if the Senate should deliberate whether or not
 to redeem the captives from the enemy.​<a class="ref" id="ref10" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/3*.html#note10" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">10</a>
 Or sometimes a question becomes one for deliberation and inquiry on 
account of some motive extraneous to the question itself; for example, 
if the Senate should deliberate whether to exempt Scipio from the law so
 as to permit him to become consul while under age.​<a class="ref" id="ref11" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/3*.html#note11" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">11</a>
 And sometimes a question comes under deliberation on its own account 
and then provokes debate even more because of an extraneous motive; for 
example, if in the Italic War the Senate should deliberate


<a id="p161"><span class="pagenum">&nbsp;p161&nbsp;</span></a>whether or not to grant <span class="whole">citizen</span>­ship to the Allies.​<a class="ref" id="ref12" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/3*.html#note12" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">12</a>
 In causes in which the subject of itself engenders the deliberation, 
the entire discourse will be devoted to the subject itself. In those in 
which an extraneous motive gives rise to the deliberation, it is this 
motive which will have to be emphasized or depreciated.

	</p><p class="justify">
<a class="sec" name="3">3</a>&nbsp;The orator who gives counsel will through his speech properly set up Advantage​<a class="ref" id="ref13" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/3*.html#note13" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">13</a> as his aim,​<a class="ref" id="ref14" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/3*.html#note14" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">14</a> so that the complete economy of his entire speech may be directed to it.

	</p><p class="justify">
Advantage in political deliberation has two aspects: Security​<a class="ref" id="ref15" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/3*.html#note15" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">15</a> and Honour.<a class="ref" id="ref16" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/3*.html#note16" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">16</a>

	</p><p class="justify">
To consider Security is to provide some plan or other for ensuring the 
avoidance of a present or imminent danger. Subheads under Security are 
Might and Craft, which we shall consider either separately or 
conjointly. Might is determined by armies, fleets, arms, engines of war,
 recruiting of man power, and the like. Craft is exercised by means of 
money, promises, dissimulation, accelerated speed, deception, and the 
other means, topics which


<a id="p163"><span class="pagenum">&nbsp;p163&nbsp;</span></a>I&nbsp;shall discuss at a more appropriate time, if ever I&nbsp;attempt to write on the art of war or on state administration.<a class="ref" id="ref17" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/3*.html#note17" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">17</a>

	</p><p class="justify">
The Honourable is divided into the Right and the Praiseworthy.​<a class="ref" id="ref18" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/3*.html#note18" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">18</a> The Right​<a class="ref" id="ref19" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/3*.html#note19" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">19</a> is that which is done in accord with Virtue and Duty. Subheads under the Right are Wisdom, Justice, Courage, and Temperance.​<a class="ref" id="ref20" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/3*.html#note20" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">20</a>
 Wisdom is intelligence capable, by a certain judicious method, of 
distinguishing good and bad; likewise the knowledge of an art is called 
Wisdom; and again, a <span class="whole">well-furnished</span> memory, 
or experience in diverse matters, is termed Wisdom. Justice is equity, 
giving to each thing what it is entitled to in proportion to its worth.​<a class="ref" id="ref21" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/3*.html#note21" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">21</a>
 Courage is the reaching for great things and contempt for what is mean;
 also the endurance of hardship in expectation of profit.​<a class="ref" id="ref22" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/3*.html#note22" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">22</a> Temperance is <span class="whole">self-control</span> that moderates our desires.<a class="ref" id="ref23" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/3*.html#note23" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">23</a>

	</p><p class="justify">
	<a class="chapter" name="R3">3</a>
<a class="sec" name="4">4</a>&nbsp;We shall be using the topics of 
Wisdom in our discourse if we compare advantages and disadvantages, 
counselling the pursuit of the one and the avoidance of the other; if we
 urge a course in a field in which we


<a id="p165"><span class="pagenum">&nbsp;p165&nbsp;</span></a>have a 
technical knowledge of the ways and means whereby each detail should be 
carried out; or if we recommend some policy in a matter whose history we
 can recall either from direct experience or hearsay — in this instance 
we can easily persuade our hearers to the course we wish by addu­cing 
the precedent.

	</p><p class="justify">
We shall be using the topics of Justice if we say that we ought to pity 
innocent persons and suppliants; if we show that it is proper to repay 
the <span class="whole">well-deserving</span> with gratitude; if we 
explain that we ought to punish the guilty; if we urge that faith ought 
zealously to be kept; if we say that the laws and customs​<a class="ref" id="ref24" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/3*.html#note24" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">24</a>
 of the state ought especially to be preserved; if we contend that 
alliances and friendships should scrupulously be honoured; if we make it
 clear that the duty imposed by nature toward parents, gods, and 
fatherland must be religiously observed; if we maintain that ties of 
hospitality, clientage, kinship, and <span class="whole">relation</span>­
ship by marriage must inviolably be cherished; if we show that neither 
reward nor favour nor peril nor animosity ought to lead us astray from 
the right path; if we say that in all cases a principle of dealing alike
 with all should be established. With these and like topics of Justice 
we shall demonstrate that an action of which we are sponsors in Assembly
 or council is just, and by their contraries we shall demonstrate that 
an action is unjust. As a result we shall be provided with the same 
commonplaces for both persuasion and dissuasion.

	</p><p class="justify">
<a class="sec" name="5">5</a>&nbsp;When we invoke as motive for a course
 of action steadfastness in Courage, we shall make it clear that men 
ought to follow and strive after noble and lofty


<a id="p167"><span class="pagenum">&nbsp;p167&nbsp;</span></a>actions, 
and that, by the same token, actions base and unworthy of the brave 
ought therefore to be despised by brave men and considered as beneath 
their dignity. Again, from an honourable act no peril or toil, however 
great, should divert us; death ought to be preferred to disgrace; no 
pain should force an abandonment of duty; no man's enmity should be 
feared in defence of truth; for country, for parents, guest-friends, 
intimates, and for the things justice commands us to respect, it behoves
 us to brave any peril and endure any toil.

	</p><p class="justify">
We shall be using the topics of Temperance if we censure the inordinate 
desire for office, money, or the like; if we restrict each thing to its 
definite natural bounds; if we show how much is enough in each case, 
advise against going too far, and set the due limit to every matter.

	</p><p class="justify">
<a class="sec" name="6">6</a>&nbsp;Virtues of this kind are to be 
enlarged upon if we are recommending them, but depreciated if we are 
urging that they be disregarded, so that the points which I&nbsp;have 
made above​<a class="ref" id="ref25" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/3*.html#note25" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">25</a>
 will be belittled. To be sure, no one will propose the abandonment of 
virtue, but let the speaker say that the affair is not of such a sort 
that we can put any extraordinary virtue to the test; or that the virtue
 consists rather of qualities contrary to those here evinced. Again, if 
it is at all possible, we shall show that what our opponent calls 
justice is cowardice, and sloth, and perverse generosity; what he has 
called wisdom we shall term impertinent, babbling, and offensive 
cleverness; what he declares to be temperance we shall declare to be 
inaction and lax indifference; what he has named


<a id="p169"><span class="pagenum">&nbsp;p169&nbsp;</span></a>courage we shall term the reckless temerity of a gladiator.<a class="ref" id="ref26" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/3*.html#note26" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">26</a>

	</p><p class="justify">
	<a class="chapter" name="R4">4</a>
<a class="sec" name="7">7</a>&nbsp;The Praiseworthy is what produces an 
honourable remembrance, at the time of the event and afterwards. 
I&nbsp;have separated the Praiseworthy from the Right, not because the 
four categories which I&nbsp;list under the appellative Right usually 
fail to engender this honourable remembrance, but because, although the 
praiseworthy has its source in the right, we must nevertheless in 
speaking treat one apart from the other. Indeed we should pursue the 
right not alone for the sake of praise; but if praise accrues, the 
desire to strive after the right is doubled. When, therefore, a thing is
 shown to be right, we shall show that it is also praiseworthy, whether 
in the opinion of qualified persons (if, for example, something should 
please a more honourable class of men, and be disapproved by a lower 
class), or of certain allies, or all our fellow citizens, or foreign 
nations, or our descendants.

	</p><p class="justify">
Such being the division of topics in deliberative speaking, I&nbsp;must briefly explain how to develop the cause as a whole.

	</p><p class="justify">
The Introduction may be made by means of the Direct Opening or of the 
Subtle Approach, or by the same means as in a judicial cause. If there 
happens to be a Statement of Facts, the same method will properly be 
followed in the narrative.

	</p><p class="justify">
<a class="sec" name="8">8</a>&nbsp;Since in causes of this kind the end 
is Advantage, and Advantage is divided into the consideration of 
Security and the consideration of Honour, if we can prove that both ends
 will be served, we shall promise


<a id="p171"><span class="pagenum">&nbsp;p171&nbsp;</span></a>to make 
this twofold proof in our discourse; if we are going to prove that one 
of the two will be served, we shall indicate simply the one thing we 
intend to affirm. If, now, we say that our aim is Security, we shall use
 its subdivisions, Might and Strategy. For that which, in instructing, 
I&nbsp;have, in order to give clarity and emphasis called Craft, we 
shall in speaking call by the more honourable name of Strategy. If we 
say that our counsel aims at the Right, and all four categories of Right
 apply, we shall use them all. If these categories do not all apply, we 
shall in speaking set forth as many as do.

	</p><p class="justify">
We shall use Proof and Refutation when we establish in our favour the 
topics explained above, and refute the contrary topics. The rules for 
developing an argument artistically will be found in Book&nbsp;II.​<a class="ref" id="ref27" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/3*.html#note27" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">27</a> <a class="chapter" name="R5">5</a>&nbsp;But
 if it happens that in a deliberation the counsel of one side is based 
on the consideration of security and that of the other on honour, as in 
the case of those who, surrounded by Carthaginians, deliberate on a 
course of action,​<a class="ref" id="ref28" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/3*.html#note28" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">28</a>
 then the speaker who advocates security will use the following topics: 
Nothing is more useful than safety; no one can make use of his virtues 
if he has not based his plans upon safety; not even the gods help those 
who thoughtlessly commit themselves to danger; nothing ought to be 
deemed honourable which does not produce safety. <a class="sec" name="9">9</a>&nbsp;One
 who prefers the considerations of honour to security will use the 
following topics: Virtue ought never to be renounced; either pain, if 
that is feared, or death, if that is dreaded, is more

than disgrace and infamy; one must consider the shame which will ensue —
 indeed neither immortality nor a life everlasting is achieved, nor is 
it proved that, once this peril is avoided, another will not be 
encountered; fortune, though, habitually favours the brave;​<a class="ref" id="ref29" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/3*.html#note29" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">29</a>

safely — whereas he who lives shamefully cannot be secure for ever.

The Introduction​<a class="ref" id="ref46" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/3*.html#note46" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">46</a> is drawn from our own person, or the person we are discussing, or the person of our hearers, or from the <span class="whole">subject-matter</span> itself.

	</p><p class="justify" id="p177"><span class="pagenum">&nbsp;p177&nbsp;</span>
From our own person: if we speak in praise, we shall say that we are 
doing so from a sense of duty, because ties of friendship exist; or from
 goodwill, because such is the virtue of the person under discussion 
that every one should wish to call it to mind; or because it is 
appropriate to show, from the praise accorded him by others, what his 
character is.​<a class="ref" id="ref47" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/3*.html#note47" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">47</a>
 If we speak in censure, we shall say that we are justified in doing so,
 because of the treatment we have suffered; or that we are doing so from
 goodwill, because we think it useful that all men should be apprised of
 a wickedness and a worthlessness without parallel; or because it is 
pleasing to show by our censure of others what conduct is pleasing to 
ourselves.

	</p><p class="justify">
When we draw our Introduction from the person being discussed: if we 
speak in praise, we shall say that we fear our inability to match his 
deeds with words;​<a class="ref" id="ref48" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/3*.html#note48" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">48</a>
 all men ought to proclaim his virtues; his very deeds transcend the 
eloquence of all eulogists. If we speak in censure, we shall, as 
obviously we can by the change of a&nbsp;few words, and as I&nbsp;have 
demonstrated just above, express sentiments to the contrary effect.

	</p><p class="justify">
<a class="sec" name="12">12</a>&nbsp;When the Introduction is drawn from
 the person of the hearers: if we speak in praise, we shall say that 
since we are not delivering an encomium amongst people unacquainted with
 the man, we shall speak but briefly, to refresh their memories; or if 
they do not know him, we shall try to make them desire to know a man of 
such excellence; since the hearers of our eulogy have the same zeal for 
virtue as the subject of the eulogy had or now has, we hope easily to 
win the approval of his deeds from those whose approval we desire. The 
opposite, if it is censure: we shall say that since


<a id="p179"><span class="pagenum">&nbsp;p179&nbsp;</span></a>our 
hearers know the man, we shall confine ourselves to a&nbsp;few words on 
the subjects of his worthlessness; but if they do not, we shall try to 
make them know him, in order that they may avoid his wickedness; since 
our hearers are unlike the subject of our censure, we express the hope 
that they will vigorously disapprove his way of life.

	</p><p class="justify">
When the Introduction is drawn from the <span class="whole">subject-matter</span>
 itself: we shall say that we do not know what to praise in particular; 
we fear that in discussing a&nbsp;number of things we shall pass by even
 more; and add whatever will carry like sentiments. The sentiments 
opposite to these are drawn upon, if we censure.

	<a class="chapter" name="R7">7</a>
<a class="sec" name="13">13</a>&nbsp;If the Introduction has been 
developed in accordance with any of the methods just mentioned, there 
will be no need for a Statement of Facts to follow it; but if there is 
occasion for one, when we must recount with either praise or censure 
some deed of the person discussed, the instructions for Stating the 
Facts will be found in Book&nbsp;I.<a class="ref" id="ref49" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/3*.html#note49" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">49</a>

	</p><p class="a0 justify">
The Division we shall make is the following: we shall set forth the 
things we intend to praise or censure; then recount the events, 
observing their precise sequence and chronology, so that one may 
understand what the person under discussion did and with what prudence 
and caution. But it will first be necessary to set forth his virtues or 
faults of character, and then to explain how, such being his character, 
he has used the advantages or disadvantages, physical or external 
circumstances. The following is the order we must keep when portraying a
 life:
	</p><p class="i1 b0 a0 justify" id="p181"><span class="pagenum">&nbsp;p181&nbsp;</span>
(1)&nbsp;External Circumstances: Descent — in praise: the ancestors of 
whom he is sprung; if he is of illustrious descent, he has been their 
peer or superior; if of humble descent, he had had his support, not in 
the virtues of his ancestors, but in his own. In censure: if he is of 
illustrious descent, he has been a disgrace to his forebears; if of low 
descent, he is none the less a dishonour even to these. Education — in 
praise: that he was well and honourably trained in worthy studies 
throughout his boyhood. In censure:&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
	</p><p class="i1 b0 a0 justify">
<a class="sec" name="14">14</a>&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;Next we must pass to the 
Physical Advantages: if by nature he has impressiveness and beauty, 
these have served him to his credit, and not, as in the case of others, 
to his detriment and shame; if he has exceptional strength and agility, 
we shall point out that these were acquired by worthy and diligent 
exercise; if he has continual good health, that was acquired by care and
 by control over his passions. In censure, if the subject has this 
physical advantages, we shall declare that he has abused what, like the 
meanest gladiator, he has had by chance and nature. If he lacks them, we
 shall say that to his own fault and want of <span class="whole">self-control</span> is his lack of every physical advantage, beauty apart, attributable.
	</p><p class="i1 b0 a0 justify">
(3)&nbsp;Then we shall return to External Circumstances and consider his
 virtues and defects of Character evinced with respect to these: Has he 
been rich or poor? What kinds of power has he wielded? What have been 
his titles to fame? What his friendships? Or what his private feuds, and
 what act of bravery has he performed in conducting these feuds? With 
what motive has he entered into feuds? With what loyalty, goodwill, and 
sense of duty has he


<a id="p183"><span class="pagenum">&nbsp;p183&nbsp;</span></a>conducted 
his friendships? What character of man has he been in wealth, or in 
poverty? What has been his attitude in the exercise of his prerogatives?
 If he is dead, what sort of death did he die,​<a class="ref" id="ref50" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/3*.html#note50" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">50</a> and what sort of consequences followed upon it? <a class="chapter" name="R8">8</a>&nbsp;<a class="sec" name="15">15</a>&nbsp;In all circumstances, moreover, in which human character is chiefly studied, those four <span class="whole">above-mentioned</span>
 virtues of character will have to be applied. Thus, if we speak in 
praise, we shall say that one act was just, another courageous, another 
temperate, and another wise; if we speak in censure, we shall declare 
that one was unjust, another intemperate, another cowardly, and another 
stupid.

	</p><p class="justify">
From this arrangement it is now no doubt clear how we are to treat the 
three categories of praise and censure — with the added proviso that we 
need not use all three for praise or for censure, because often not all 
of them even apply, and often, too, when they do, the application is so 
slight that it is unnecessary to refer to them. We shall therefore need 
to choose those categories which seem to provide the greatest force.

	</p><p class="justify">
Our Conclusions will be brief, in the form of a Summary at the end of 
the discourse; in the discourse itself we shall by means of commonplaces
 frequently insert brief amplifications.

	</p><p class="justify">
Nor should this kind of cause​<a class="ref" id="ref51" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/3*.html#note51" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">51</a>
 be the less strongly recommended just because it presents itself only 
seldom in life. Indeed when a task may present itself, be it only 
occasionally, the ability to perform it as skilfully as possible must 
seem desirable. And if epideictic is only seldom employed by itself 
independently, still in judicial and deliberative causes extensive 
sections are often devoted to praise or


<a id="p185"><span class="pagenum">&nbsp;p185&nbsp;</span></a>censure. Therefore let us believe that this kind of cause also must claim some measure of our industry.

	</p><p class="justify">
Now that I&nbsp;have completed the most difficult part of rhetoric — 
thoroughly treating Invention and applying it to every kind of cause — 
it is time to proceed to the other parts. I&nbsp;shall therefore next​<a class="ref" id="ref52" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/3*.html#note52" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">52</a> discuss the Arrangement.

	</p><p class="justify">
	<a class="chapter" name="R9">9</a>
<a class="sec" name="16">16</a>&nbsp;Since it is through the Arrangement​<a class="ref" id="ref53" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/3*.html#note53" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">53</a>
 that we set in order the topics we have invented so that there may be a
 definite place for each in the delivery, we must see how kind of method
 one should follow in the process of arranging. The kinds of Arrangement
 are two: one arising from the principles of rhetoric, the other 
accommodated to particular circumstances.

	</p><p class="justify">
Our Arrangement will be based on the principles of rhetoric when we 
observe instructions that I&nbsp;have set forth in Book&nbsp;I​<a class="ref" id="ref54" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/3*.html#note54" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">54</a>
 — to use the Introduction, Statement of Facts, Division, Proof, 
Refutation, and Conclusion, and in speaking to follow the order enjoined
 above. It is likewise on the principles of the art that we shall be 
basing our Arrangement, not only of the whole case throughout the 
discourse, but also of the individual arguments, according to 
Proposition, Reason, Proof of the Reason, Embellishment, and Résumé, as 
I&nbsp;have explained in Book&nbsp;II.​<a class="ref" id="ref55" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/3*.html#note55" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">55</a> <a class="sec" name="17">17</a>&nbsp;This Arrangement, then, is twofold — one for the whole speech, and the other for the individual


<a id="p187"><span class="pagenum">&nbsp;p187&nbsp;</span></a>arguments — and is based upon the principles of rhetoric.

	</p><p class="justify">
But there is also another Arrangement, which, when we must depart from 
the order imposed by the rules of the art, is accommodated to 
circumstance in accordance with the speaker's judgement;​<a class="ref" id="ref56" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/3*.html#note56" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">56</a>
 for example, if we should begin our speech with the Statement of Facts,
 or with some very strong argument, or the reading of some documents; or
 if straightway after the Introduction we should use the Proof and then 
the Statement of Facts; or if we should make some other change of this 
kind in the order. But none of these changes ought to be made except 
when our cause demands them. For if the ears of the audience seem to 
have been deafened and their attention wearied by the wordiness of our 
adversaries, we can advantageously omit the Introduction,​<a class="ref" id="ref57" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/3*.html#note57" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">57</a>
 and begin the speech with either the Statement of Facts or some strong 
argument. Then, if it is advantageous — for it is not always necessary —
 one may recur to the idea intended for the Introduction. <a class="chapter" name="R10">10</a>&nbsp;If
 our cause seems to present so great a difficulty that no one can listen
 to the Introduction with patience, we shall begin with the Statement of
 Facts and then recur to the idea intended for the Introduction. If the 
Statement of Facts is not quite plausible, we shall begin with some 
strong argument. It is often necessary to employ such changes and 
transpositions when the cause itself obliges us to modify with art the 
Arrangement prescribed by the rules of the art.

	</p><p class="justify" id="p189"><span class="pagenum">&nbsp;p189&nbsp;</span>
<a class="sec" name="18">18</a>&nbsp;In the Proof and Refutation of 
arguments it is appropriate to adopt an Arrangement of the following 
sort: (1)&nbsp;the strongest arguments should be placed at the beginning
 and at the end of the pleading; (2)&nbsp;those of medium force, and 
also those that are neither useless to the discourse nor essential to 
the proof, which are weak if presented separately and individually, but 
become strong and plausible when conjoined with the others, should be 
placed in the middle.​<a class="ref" id="ref58" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/3*.html#note58" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">58</a> For immediately after the facts have been <span class="whole">stated</span>
 the hearer waits to see whether the cause can by some means be proved, 
and that is why we ought straightway to present some strong argument. 
(3)&nbsp;And as for the rest, since what has been said last is easily 
committed to memory, it is useful, when ceasing to speak, to leave some 
very strong argument fresh in the hearer's mind. This arrangement of 
topics in speaking, like the arraying of soldiers in battle, can readily
 bring victory.

	</p><p class="justify">
	<a class="chapter" name="R11">11</a>
<a class="sec" name="19">19</a>&nbsp;Many have said that the faculty of 
greatest use to the speaker and the most valuable for persuasion is 
Delivery. For my part, I&nbsp;should not readily say that any one of the
 five faculties​<a class="ref" id="ref59" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/3*.html#note59" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">59</a> is the most important; that an exceptionally great usefulness resides in the delivery I&nbsp;should boldly affirm.​<a class="ref" id="ref60" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/3*.html#note60" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">60</a> For


<a id="p191"><span class="pagenum">&nbsp;p191&nbsp;</span></a>skilful 
invention, elegant style, the artistic management of the parts 
comprising the case, and the careful memory of all these will be of no 
more value without delivery, than delivery alone and independent of 
these. Therefore, because no one has written carefully on this subject​<a class="ref" id="ref61" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/3*.html#note61" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">61</a> — all have thought it scarcely possible for voice, mien, and gesture to be lucidly described, as appertaining to our <span class="whole">sense-experience</span>
 — and because the mastery of delivery is a very important requisite for
 speaking, the whole subject, as I&nbsp;believe, deserves serious 
consideration.

	</p><p class="justify">
Delivery, then, includes Voice Quality and Physical Movement.​<a class="ref" id="ref62" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/3*.html#note62" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">62</a> Voice Quality​<a class="ref" id="ref63" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/3*.html#note63" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">63</a> has a certain character of its own, acquired by method and application. <a class="sec" name="20">20</a>&nbsp;It has three aspects: Volume, Stability, and Flexibility. Vocal volume is primarily the gift of nature; cultivation​<a class="ref" id="ref64" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/3*.html#note64" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">64</a> augments it somewhat, but chiefly conserves it.


<a id="p193"><span class="pagenum">&nbsp;p193&nbsp;</span></a>Stability 
is primarily gained by cultivation; declamatory exercise augments it 
somewhat, but chiefly conserves it. Vocal flexibility — the ability in 
speaking to vary the intonations of the voice at pleasure — is primarily
 achieved by declamatory exercise.​<a class="ref" id="ref65" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/3*.html#note65" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">65</a>
 Thus with regard to vocal volume, and in a degree also to stability, 
since one is the gift of nature and the other is acquired by 
cultivation, it is pointless to give any other advice than that the 
method of cultivating the voice should be sought from those skilled in 
this art.​<a class="ref" id="ref66" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/3*.html#note66" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">66</a> <a class="chapter" name="R12">12</a>&nbsp;It
 seems, however, that I&nbsp;must discuss stability in the degree that 
it is conserved by a system of declamation, and also vocal flexibility 
(this is especially necessary to the speaker), because it too is 
acquired by the discipline of declamation.

	</p><p class="justify">
<a class="sec" name="21">21</a>&nbsp;We can, then, in speaking conserve 
stability mainly by using for the Introduction a voice as calm and 
composed as possible. For the windpipe is injured if filled with a 
violent outburst of sound before it has been soothed by soft 
intonations. And it is appropriate to use rather long pauses — the voice
 is refreshed by respiration and the windpipe is rested by silence. We 
should also relax from continual use of the full voice and pass to the 
tone of conversation; for, as the result of changes, no one kind of tone
 is spent, and we are complete in the entire range. Again, we ought to 
avoid piercing exclamations, for a shock that wounds the windpipe is 
produced by shouting which is excessively sharp and shrill,​<a class="ref" id="ref67" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/3*.html#note67" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">67</a>
 and the brilliance of the voice is altogether used up by one outburst. 
Again, at the end of the speech it is proper to deliver long periods in 
one unbroken


<a id="p195"><span class="pagenum">&nbsp;p195&nbsp;</span></a>breath,​<a class="ref" id="ref68" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/3*.html#note68" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">68</a>
 for then the throat becomes warm, the windpipe is filled, and the 
voice, which has been used in a variety of tones, is restored to a kind 
of uniform and constant tone. How often must we be duly thankful to 
nature, as here! Indeed what we declare to be beneficial for conserving 
the voice applies also to agreeableness of delivery, and, as a result, 
what benefits our voice likewise finds favour in the hearer's taste. <a class="sec" name="22">22</a>&nbsp;A&nbsp;useful thing for stability is a calm tone in the Introduction.​<a class="ref" id="ref69" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/3*.html#note69" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">69</a>
 What is more disagreeable than the full voice in the Introduction to a 
discourse? Pauses strengthen the voice. They also render the thoughts 
more clear-cut by separating them, and leave the hearer time to think. 
Relaxation from a continuous full tone conserves the voice, and the 
variety gives extreme pleasure to the hearer too, since now the 
conversational tone holds the attention and now the full voice rouses 
it. Sharp exclamation injures the voice and likewise jars the hearer, 
for it has about it something ignoble, suited rather to feminine outcry 
than to manly dignity in speaking. At the end of the speech a sustained 
flow is beneficial to the voice. And does not this, too, most vigorously
 stir the hearer at the Conclusion of the entire discourse? Since, then,
 the same means serve stability of the voice and agreeableness of 
delivery, my present discussion will have dealt with both at once, 
offering as it does the observations that have seemed appropriate on 
stability, and the related observations on agreeableness. The rest 
I&nbsp;shall set forth somewhat later, in its proper place.<a class="ref" id="ref70" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/3*.html#note70" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">70</a>

<a class="sec" name="23">23</a>&nbsp;Now the flexibility of the voice, 
since it depends entirely on rhetorical rules, deserves our more careful
 consideration. The aspects of Flexibility are Conversational Tone, Tone
 of Debate, and Tone of Amplification. The Tone of Conversation is 
relaxed,​<a class="ref" id="ref71" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/3*.html#note71" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">71</a> and is closest to daily speech. The Tone of Debate is energetic, and is suited to both proof and refutation.​<a class="ref" id="ref72" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/3*.html#note72" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">72</a> The Tone of Amplification either rouses the hearer to wrath or moves him to pity.

	</p><p class="justify" id="conversational_tone">
Conversational Tone<!-- Loeb forgets to capitalize --> comprises four kinds: the Dignified,​<a class="ref" id="ref73" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/3*.html#note73" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">73</a>
 The Explicative, the Narrative, and the Facetious. The Dignified, or 
Serious, Tone of Conversation is marked by some degree of impressiveness
 and by vocal restraint. The Explicative in a calm voice explains how 
something could or could not have been brought to pass. The Narrative 
sets forth events that have occurred or might have occurred.​<a class="ref" id="ref74" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/3*.html#note74" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">74</a> The Facetious can on the basis of some circumstance elicit a laugh which is modest and refined.<a class="ref" id="ref75" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/3*.html#note75" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">75</a>

	</p><p class="justify" id="tone_of_debate">
In the Tone of Debate are distinguishable the Sustained and the Broken. The Sustained is <span class="whole">full-voiced</span>
 and accelerated delivery. The Broken Tone of Debate is punctuated 
repeatedly with short, intermittent pauses, and is vociferated sharply.

	</p><p class="justify" id="tone_of_amplification">
<a class="sec" name="24">24</a>&nbsp;The Tone of Amplification includes the Hortatory and the Pathetic. The Hortatory, by amplifying


<a id="p199"><span class="pagenum">&nbsp;p199&nbsp;</span></a>some fault, incites the hearer to indignation. The Pathetic, by amplifying misfortunes, wins the hearer over to pity.<a class="ref" id="ref76" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/3*.html#note76" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">76</a>

	</p><p class="justify">
Since, then, vocal flexibility is divided into three tones, and these in
 turn subdivide into eight others, it appears that we must explain what 
delivery is appropriate to each of these eight subdivisions.

	</p><p class="justify">
	<a class="chapter" name="R14">14</a>
(1)&nbsp;For the Dignified Conversational Tone it will be proper to use 
the full throat but the calmest and most subdued voice possible, yet not
 in such a fashion that we pass from the practice of the orator to that 
of the tragedian.​<a class="ref" id="ref77" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/3*.html#note77" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">77</a>
 (2)&nbsp;For the Explicative Conversational Tone one ought to use a 
rather thin-toned voice, and frequent pauses and intermissions, so that 
we seem by means of the delivery itself to implant and engrave in the 
hearer's mind the points we are making in our explanation. (3)&nbsp;For 
the Narrative Conversational Tone varied intonations are necessary, so 
that we seem to recount everything just as it took place. Our delivery 
will be somewhat rapid when we narrate what we wish to show was done 
vigorously, and it will be slower when we narrate something else done in
 leisurely fashion. Then, corresponding to the content of the words, we 
shall modify the delivery in all the kinds of tone, now to sharpness, 
now to kindness, or now to sadness, and now to gaiety. If in the 
Statement of Facts there occur any declarations, demands, replies, or 
exclamations of astonishment concerning the facts we are narrating, we 
shall give careful attention to expressing with the voice the


<a id="p201"><span class="pagenum">&nbsp;p201&nbsp;</span></a>feelings and thoughts of each personage. <a class="sec" name="25">25</a>&nbsp;
(4)&nbsp;For the Facetious Conversational Tone, with a gentle quiver in 
the voice, and a slight suggestion of a smile, but without any trace of 
immoderate laughter, one ought to shift one's utterance smoothly from 
the Serious Conversational Tone<!-- Loeb forgets to capitalize --> to the tone of gentlemanly jest.

	</p><p class="justify">
Since the Tone of Debate is to be expressed either through the Sustained
 or the Broken, when the (5)&nbsp;Sustained Tone of Debate is required, 
one ought moderately to increase the vocal volume, and, in maintaining 
an uninterrupted flow of words, also to bring the voice into harmony 
with them, to inflect the tone accordingly, and to deliver the words 
rapidly in a full voice, so that the voice production can follow the 
fluent energy of the speech. (6)&nbsp;For the Broken Tone of Debate we 
must with deepest chest tones produce the clearest possible 
exclamations, and I&nbsp;advise giving as much time to each pause as to 
each exclamation.

	</p><p class="justify">
For (7)&nbsp;the Hortatory Tone of Amplification we shall use a very 
thin-toned voice, moderate loudness, an even flow of sound, frequent 
modulations, and the utmost speed. (8)&nbsp;For the Pathetic Tone of 
Amplification we shall use a restrained voice, deep tone, frequent 
intermissions, long pauses, and marked changes.

	</p><p class="justify">
	<a class="chapter" name="R15">15</a>
On Voice Quality enough has been said. Now it seems best to discuss Physical Movement.

	</p><p class="justify">
<a class="sec" name="26">26</a>&nbsp;Physical Movement<!-- Loeb forgets to capitalize -->​<a class="ref" id="ref78" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/3*.html#note78" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">78</a>
 consists in a certain control of gesture and mien which renders what is
 delivered more plausible. Accordingly the facial expression should show
 modesty and animation, and the gestures should not be conspicuous for 
either elegance or


<a id="p203"><span class="pagenum">&nbsp;p203&nbsp;</span></a>grossness,​<a class="ref" id="ref79" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/3*.html#note79" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">79</a>
 lest we give the impression that we are either actors or day labourers.
 It seems, then, that the rules regulating bodily movement ought to 
correspond to the several divisions of tone comprising voice. To 
illustrate: (1)&nbsp;For the Dignified Conversational Tone, the speaker 
must stay in position when he speaks, lightly moving his right hand, his
 countenance expressing an emotion corresponding to the sentiments of 
the subject — gaiety or sadness or an emotion intermediate. (2)&nbsp;For
 the Explicative Conversational Tone, we shall incline the body forward a
 little from the shoulders, since it is natural to bring the face as 
close as possible to our hearers when we wish to prove a point and 
arouse them vigorously. (3)&nbsp;For the Narrative Conversational Tone, 
the same physical movement as I&nbsp;have just set forth for the 
Dignified will be appropriate. (4)&nbsp;For the Facetious Conversational
 Tone, we should by our countenance express a certain gaiety, without 
changing gestures.

	</p><p class="justify">
<a class="sec" name="27">27</a>&nbsp;(5)&nbsp;For the Sustained Tone of 
Debate, we shall use a quick gesture of the arm, a mobile countenance, 
and a keen glance. (6)&nbsp;For the Broken Tone of Debate, one must 
extend the arm very quickly, walk up and down, occasionally stamp the 
right foot, and adopt a keen and fixed look.

	</p><p class="justify">
(7)&nbsp;For the Hortatory Tone of Amplification, it will be appropriate
 to use a somewhat slower and more deliberate gesticulation, but 
otherwise to follow the procedure for the Sustained Tone of Debate. 
(8)&nbsp;For the Pathetic Tone of Amplification,


<a id="p205"><span class="pagenum">&nbsp;p205&nbsp;</span></a>one ought to slap one's thigh​<a class="ref" id="ref80" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/3*.html#note80" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">80</a> and beat one's head, and sometimes to use a calm and uniform gesticulation and a sad and disturbed expression.

	</p><p class="justify">
I&nbsp;am not unaware how great a task I&nbsp;have undertaken in trying 
to express physical movements in words and portray vocal intonations in 
writing. True, I&nbsp;was not confident that it was possible to treat 
these matters adequately in writing. Yet neither did&nbsp;I suppose 
that, if such a treatment were impossible, it would follow that what 
I&nbsp;have done here would be useless, for it has been my purpose 
merely to suggest what ought to be done. The rest I&nbsp;shall leave to 
practice. This, nevertheless, one must remember: good delivery ensures 
that what the orator is saying seems to come from his heart. <a class="chapter" name="R16">16</a>&nbsp;<a class="sec" name="28">28</a>&nbsp;Now let me turn to the <span class="whole">treasure-house</span> of the ideas supplied by Invention, to the guardian of all the parts of rhetoric, the Memory.<a class="ref" id="ref81" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/3*.html#note81" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">81</a>

	</p><p class="justify">
The question whether memory has some artificial quality, or comes 
entirely from nature, we shall have another, more favourable, 
opportunity to discuss. At present I&nbsp;shall accept as proved that in
 this matter art and method are of great importance, and shall treat the
 subject accordingly. For my part, I&nbsp;am


<a id="p207"><span class="pagenum">&nbsp;p207&nbsp;</span></a>satisfied that there is an art of memory — the grounds of my belief I&nbsp;shall explain elsewhere.​<a class="ref" id="ref82" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/3*.html#note82" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">82</a> For the present I&nbsp;shall disclose what sort of thing memory is.

	</p><p class="justify">
There are, then, two kinds of memory: one natural, and the other the 
product of art. The natural memory is that memory which is imbedded in 
our minds, born simultaneously with thought. The artificial memory is 
that memory which is strengthened by a kind of training and system of 
discipline. But just as in everything else the merit of natural 
excellence often rivals acquired learning, and art, in its turn, 
reinforces and develops the natural advantages,​<a class="ref" id="ref83" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/3*.html#note83" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">83</a> so does it happen in this instance. The natural memory, if a person is endowed with an exceptional one, <a class="sec" name="29">29</a>&nbsp;is
 often like this artificial memory, and this artificial memory, in its 
turn, retains and develops the natural advantages by a method of 
discipline. Thus the natural memory must be strengthened by discipline 
so as to become exceptional, and, on the other hand, this memory 
provided by discipline requires natural ability. It is neither more nor 
less true in this instance than in the other arts that science strives 
by the aid of innate ability, and nature by the aid of the rules of art.
 The training here offered will therefore also be useful to those who by
 nature have a good memory, as you will yourself soon come to 
understand.​<a class="ref" id="ref84" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/3*.html#note84" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">84</a>
 But even if these, relying on their natural talent, did not need our 
help, we should still be justified in wishing to aid the less <span class="whole">well-endowed</span>. Now I&nbsp;shall discuss the artificial memory.

	</p><p class="justify" id="p209"><span class="pagenum">&nbsp;p209&nbsp;</span>
The artificial memory includes backgrounds and images. By backgrounds 
I&nbsp;mean such scenes as are naturally or artificially set off on a 
small scale, complete and conspicuous, so that we can grasp and embrace 
them easily by the natural memory — for example, a house, an 
intercolumnar space, a recess, an arch, or the like. An image is, as it 
were, a figure, mark, or portrait of the object we wish to remember; for
 example, if we wish to recall a horse, a lion, or an eagle, we must 
place its image in a definite background. <a class="sec" name="30">30</a>&nbsp;Now
 I&nbsp;shall show what kind of backgrounds we should invent and how we 
should discover the images and set them therein.

	</p><p class="justify">
	<a class="chapter" name="R17">17</a>
Those who know the letters of the alphabet can thereby write out what is
 dictated to them and read aloud what they have written. Likewise, those
 who have learned mnemonics can set in backgrounds what they have heard,
 and from these backgrounds deliver it by memory. For the backgrounds 
are very much like wax tablets​<a class="ref" id="ref85" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/3*.html#note85" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">85</a>
 or papyrus, the images like letters, the arrangement and disposition of
 the images like the script, and the delivery is like the reading. We 
should therefore, if we desire to memorize a large number of items, 
equip ourselves with a large number of backgrounds, so that in these we 
may set a large number of images. I&nbsp;likewise think it obligatory to
 have these backgrounds in a series, so that we never by confusion in 
their order be prevented from following the images&nbsp;—


<a id="p211"><span class="pagenum">&nbsp;p211&nbsp;</span></a>proceeding
 from any background we wish, whatsoever its place in the series, and 
whether we go forwards or backwards — nor from delivering orally what 
has been committed to the backgrounds. <a class="chapter" name="R18">18</a>&nbsp;For
 example, if we should see a great number of our acquaintances standing 
in a certain order, it would not make any difference to us whether we 
should tell their names beginning with the person standing at the head 
of the line or at the foot or in the middle. So with respect to the 
backgrounds. If these have been arranged in order, the result will be 
that, reminded by the images, we can repeat orally what we committed to 
the backgrounds, proceeding in either direction from any background we 
please. <a class="sec" name="31">31</a>&nbsp;That is why it also seems best to arrange the backgrounds in a series.

	</p><p class="justify">
We shall need to study with special care the backgrounds we have adopted
 so that they may cling lastingly in our memory, for the images, like 
letters, are effaced when we make no use of them, but the backgrounds, 
like wax tablets, should abide. And that we may by no chance err in the 
number of backgrounds, each fifth background should be marked. For 
example, if in the fifth we should set a golden hand, and in the tenth 
some acquaintance whose first name is Decimus, it will then be easy to 
station like marks in each successive fifth background. <a class="chapter" name="R19">19</a>&nbsp;Again,
 it will be more advantageous to obtain backgrounds in a deserted than 
in a populous region, because the crowding and passing to and fro of 
people confuse and weaken the impress of the images, while solitude 
keeps their outlines sharp. Further, backgrounds differing in form and 
nature must be secured, so that, thus distinguished, they


<a id="p213"><span class="pagenum">&nbsp;p213&nbsp;</span></a>may be 
clearly visible; for if a person has adopted many intercolumnar spaces, 
their resemblance to one another will so confuse him that he will no 
longer know what he has set in each background. And these backgrounds 
ought to be of moderate size and medium extent, for when excessively 
large they render the images vague, and when too small often seem 
incapable of receiving an arrangement of images. <a class="sec" name="32">32</a>&nbsp;Then
 the backgrounds ought to be neither too bright nor too dim, so that the
 shadows may not obscure the images nor the lustre make them glitter. 
I&nbsp;believe that the intervals between backgrounds should be of 
moderate extent, approximately thirty feet; for, like the external eye, 
so the inner eye of thought is less <span class="whole">power</span>­ful when you have moved the object of sight too near or too far away.

	</p><p class="justify">
Although it is easy for a person with a relatively large experience to 
equip himself with as many and as suitable backgrounds as he may desire,
 even a person who believes that he finds no store of backgrounds that 
are good enough, may succeed in fashioning as many such as he wishes. 
For the imagination can embrace any region whatsoever and in it at will 
fashion and construct the setting of some background. Hence, if we are 
not content with our <span class="whole">ready-made</span> supply of 
backgrounds, we may in our imagination create a region for ourselves and
 obtain a most serviceable distribution of appropriate backgrounds.

	</p><p class="justify">
On the subject of backgrounds enough has been said; let me now turn to the theory of images.

	</p><p class="justify">
	<a class="chapter" name="R20">20</a>
<a class="sec" name="33">33</a>&nbsp;Since, then, images must resemble 
objects, we ought ourselves to choose from all objects likenesses for 
our use. Hence likenesses are bound to


<a id="p215"><span class="pagenum">&nbsp;p215&nbsp;</span></a>be of two kinds, one of <span class="whole">subject-matter</span>,​<a class="ref" id="ref86" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/3*.html#note86" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">86</a>
 the other of words. Likenesses of matter are formed when we enlist 
images that present a general view of the matter with which we are 
dealing; likenesses of words are established when the record of each 
single noun or appellative is kept by an image.

	</p><p class="justify">
Often we encompass the record of an entire matter by one notation, a 
single image. For example, the prosecutor has said that the defendant 
killed a man by poison, has charged that the motive for the crime was an
 inheritance, and declared that there are many witnesses and accessories
 to this act. If in order to facilitate our defence we wish to remember 
this first point, we shall in our first background form an image of the 
whole matter. We shall picture the man in question as lying ill in bed, 
if we know his person. If we do not know him, we shall yet take some one
 to be our invalid, but a man of the lowest class, so that he may come 
to mind at once. And we shall place the defendant at the bedside, 
holding in his right hand a cup, and in his left tablets, and on the 
fourth finger​<a class="ref" id="ref87" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/3*.html#note87" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">87</a> a ram's testicles. In this way we can record the man who was poisoned, the inheritance, and the witnesses. <a class="sec" name="34">34</a>&nbsp;In
 like fashion we shall set the other counts of the charge in backgrounds
 successively, following their order, and whenever we wish to remember a
 point, by properly arranging the patterns of the backgrounds​<a class="ref" id="ref88" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/3*.html#note88" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">88</a> and carefully imprinting the images, we shall easily succeed in calling back to mind what we wish.

	</p><p class="justify" id="p217"><span class="pagenum">&nbsp;p217&nbsp;</span>
	<a class="chapter" name="R21">21</a>
When we wish to represent by images the likenesses of words, we shall be
 undertaking a greater task and exercising our ingenuity the more. This 
we ought to effect in the following way:

</p><div align="center"><table>
	<tbody><tr>
		<td><div class="Latin verse">
			<p>
Iam domum itionem reges Atridae arant.​<a class="ref" id="ref89" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/3*.html#note89" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">89</a>

<div align="center"><table class="verse">

		<td>
			<p>
"And now their <span class="whole">home-coming</span> the kings, the sons of Atreus, are making ready."
		</p></td>
	</tr>
</tbody></table></div>

	<p class="halfstart justify">
If we wish to remember this verse, in our first background we should put
 Domitius, raising hands to heaven while he is lashed by the Marcii 
Reges​<a class="ref" id="ref90" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/3*.html#note90" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">90</a> — that will represent "<span lang="la" class="Latin">Iam domum itionem reges</span>" ("And now their <span class="whole">home-coming</span> the kings,"); in the second background, Aesopus and Cimber,​<a class="ref" id="ref91" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/3*.html#note91" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">91</a> being dressed as for the rôles of Agamemnon and Menelaüs in <i>Iphigenia</i> — that will represent "<span lang="la" class="Latin">Atridae parant</span>"
 ("the sons of Atreus, making ready"). By this method all the words will
 be represented. But such an arrangement of images succeeds only if we 
use our notation to stimulate the natural memory, so that we first go 
over a given verse twice or three times to ourselves and then represent 
the words by means of images. In this way art will supplement nature. 
For neither by itself will be strong enough, though we must note that 
theory and technique are much the more reliable. I&nbsp;should not 
hesitate to


<a id="p219"><span class="pagenum">&nbsp;p219&nbsp;</span></a>demonstrate
 this in detail, did&nbsp;I not fear that, once having departed from my 
plan, I&nbsp;should not so well preserve the clear conciseness of my 
instruction.

	</p><p class="justify">
<a class="sec" name="35">35</a>&nbsp;Now, since in normal cases some 
images are strong and sharp and suitable for awakening recollection, and
 others so weak and feeble as hardly to succeed in stimulating memory, 
we must therefore consider the cause of these differences, so that, by 
knowing the cause, we may know which images to avoid and which to seek.

	</p><p class="justify">
	<a class="chapter" name="R22">22</a>
Now nature herself teaches us what we should do. When we see in everyday
 life things that are petty, ordinary, and banal, we generally fail to 
remember them, because the mind is not being stirred by anything novel 
or marvellous. But if we see or hear something exceptionally base, 
dishonourable, extraordinary, great, unbelievable, or laughable, that we
 are likely to remember a long time. Accordingly, things immediate to 
our eye or ear we commonly forget; incidents of our childhood we often 
remember best.​<a class="ref" id="ref92" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/3*.html#note92" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">92</a>
 Nor could this be so for any other reason than that ordinary things 
easily slip from the memory while the striking and novel stay longer in 
mind. <a class="sec" name="36">36</a>&nbsp;A&nbsp;sunrise, the sun's course, a sunset, are marvellous to no one because they occur daily.​<a class="ref" id="ref93" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/3*.html#note93" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">93</a>
 But solar eclipses are a source of wonder because they occur seldom, 
and indeed are more marvellous than lunar eclipses, because these are 
more frequent. Thus nature shows that she is not aroused by the common,

nature is never last, education never first; rather the beginnings of 
things arise from natural talent, and the ends are reached by 
discipline.

<a class="sec" name="37">37</a>&nbsp;We ought, then, to set up images of
 a kind that can adhere longest in the memory. And we shall do so if we 
establish likenesses as striking as possible; if we set up images that 
are not many or vague, but doing something; if we assign to them 
exceptional beauty or singular ugliness; if we dress some of them with 
crowns or purple cloaks, for example, so that the likeness may be more 
distinct to us; or if we somehow disfigure them, as by introdu­cing one 
stained with blood or soiled with mud or smeared with red paint, so that
 its form is more striking, or by assigning certain comic effects to our
 images, for that, too, will ensure our remembering them more readily. 
The things we easily remember when they are real we likewise remember 
without difficulty when they are figments, if they have been carefully 
delineated. But this will be essential — again and again to run over 
rapidly in the mind all the original backgrounds in order to refresh the
 images.

	</p><p class="justify">
	<a class="chapter" name="R23">23</a>
<a class="sec" name="38">38</a>&nbsp;I&nbsp;know that most of the Greeks who have written on the memory​<a class="ref" id="ref95" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/3*.html#note95" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">95</a>
 have taken the course of listing images that correspond to a great many
 words, so that persons who wished to learn these images by heart would 
have them ready without expending effort on a search for them. 
I&nbsp;disapprove of their method on several grounds. First, among the


<a id="p223"><span class="pagenum">&nbsp;p223&nbsp;</span></a>innumerable
 multitude of words it is ridiculous to collect images for 
a&nbsp;thousand. How meagre is the value these can have, when out of the
 infinite store of words we shall need to remember now one, and now 
another? Secondly, why do we wish to rob anybody of his initiative, so 
that, to save him from making any search himself, we deliver to him 
everything searched out and ready? Then again, one person is more struck
 by one likeness, and another more by another. Often in fact when we 
declare that some one form resembles another, we fail to receive 
universal assent, because things seem different to different persons. 
The same is true with respect to images: one that is <span class="whole">well-defined</span> to us appears relatively inconspicuous to others. <a class="sec" name="39">39</a>&nbsp;Everybody,
 therefore, should in equipping himself with images suit his own 
convenience. Finally, it is the instructor's duty to teach the proper 
method of search in each case, and, for the sake of greater clarity, to 
add in illustration some one or two examples of its kind, but not all. 
For instance, when I&nbsp;discuss the search for Introductions, 
I&nbsp;give a method of search and do not draught a&nbsp;thousand kinds 
of Introductions. The same procedure I&nbsp;believe should be followed 
with respect to images.

	</p><p class="justify">
	<a class="chapter" name="R24">24</a>
Now, lest you should perchance regard the memorizing of words either as 
too difficult or as of too little use, and so rest content with the 
memorizing of matter, as being easier and more useful, I&nbsp;must 
advise you why I&nbsp;do not disapprove of memorizing words. 
I&nbsp;believe that they who wish to do easy things without trouble and 
toil must previously have been trained in more difficult things. Nor 
have&nbsp;I included memorization of words to enable us to get


<a id="p225"><span class="pagenum">&nbsp;p225&nbsp;</span></a>verse by 
rote, but rather as an exercise whereby to strengthen that other kind of
 memory, the memory of matter, which is of practical use. Thus we may 
without effort pass from this difficult training to ease in that other 
memory. <a class="sec" name="40">40</a>&nbsp;In every discipline 
artistic theory is of little avail without unremitting exercise, but 
especially in mnemonics theory is almost valueless unless made good by 
industry, devotion, toil, and care. You can make sure that you have as 
many backgrounds as possible and that these conform as much as possible 
to the rules; in pla­cing the images you should exercise every day. 
While an engrossing preoccupation may often distract us from our other 
pursuits, from this activity nothing whatever can divert us. Indeed 
there is never a moment when we do not wish to commit something to 
memory, and we wish it most of all when our attention is held by 
business of special importance. So, since a ready memory is a useful 
thing, you see clearly with what great pains we must strive to acquire 
so useful a faculty. Once you know its uses you will be able to 
appreciate this advice. To exhort you further in the matter of memory is
 not my intention, for I&nbsp;should appear either to have lacked 
confidence in your zeal or to have discussed the subject less fully than
 it demands.

	</p><p class="justify">
I&nbsp;shall next discuss the fifth part of rhetoric. You might rehearse
 in your mind each of the first four divisions, and — what is especially
 necessary — fortify your knowledge of them with exercise.

When examined on its own account, this question might, for example, be 
considered as involving a radical change in Roman institutions; 
a&nbsp;motive "extraneous" to the question itself might be the effect of
 the measure upon other allies now threatening defection.

above), receives only a sketchy treatment from our author — evidence of the dominant position which the judicial kind, with its <span lang="la" class="Latin">status</span>
 system, held in Hellenistic rhetoric. Despite the Epicurean notion that
 only epideictic was amenable to rules, the judicial kind was in fact 
the easiest to systematize, even as it was by far the most often 
employed in Hellenistic times. The Greek term "epideictic" did not 
primarily emphasize the speaker's virtuosity, nor was the Latin 
equivalent <span lang="la" class="Latin">demonstrativum</span> intended to imply logical demonstration. Whereas in both


<a id="p173x"></a>deliberative and judicial causes the speaker seeks to 
persuade his hearers to a course of action, in epideictic his primary 
purpose is by means of his art to impress his ideas upon them, without 
action as a goal. On the scope and purpose of epideictic, and on the 
discrepancies between our author's treatment and that of Aristotle (<i>Rhet.</i>&nbsp;1.3, 1358<span class="small">B</span>), see D.&nbsp;A.&nbsp;G.&nbsp;Hinks, <i>Class. Quart.</i>&nbsp;30&nbsp;(1936), 170‑6<!--</A>JOURNAL:CQ:30-->; <i>cf.</i>&nbsp;also
