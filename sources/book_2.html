	<a id="p59"><span class="pagenum">&nbsp;p59&nbsp;</span></a>
Book&nbsp;II
	</h1>


	<p class="start justify">
	<a class="chapter" name="R1">1</a>
<a class="sec" name="1">1</a>&nbsp;In the preceding Book, Herennius, I&nbsp;briefly set forth the causes with which the speaker must deal,​<a class="ref" id="ref1" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/2*.html#note1" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">1</a>
 and also the functions of his art to which he may well devote his 
pains, and the means by which he can most easily fulfil these 
functions.​<a class="ref" id="ref2" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/2*.html#note2" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">2</a>
 But since it was impossible to treat all the topics at once, and 
I&nbsp;had primarily to discuss the most important of them in order that
 the rest might prove easier for you to understand, I&nbsp;therefore 
decided to write first upon those that are the most difficult.

	</p><p class="justify">
There are three kinds of causes: Epideictic, Deliberative, and Judicial.
 By far the most difficult is the judicial; that is why, I&nbsp;have 
disposed of this kind first of all. Of the five tasks of the speaker 
Invention is the most important​<a class="ref" id="ref3" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/2*.html#note3" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">3</a>
 and the most difficult. That topic too I&nbsp;shall virtually have 
disposed of in the present Book; small details will be postponed to 
Book&nbsp;III.<a class="ref" id="ref4" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/2*.html#note4" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">4</a>

	</p><p class="justify">
<a class="sec" name="2">2</a>&nbsp;I&nbsp;first undertook to discuss the
 six parts of a discourse. In the preceding Book I&nbsp;spoke about the 
Introduction, the Statement of Facts, and the Division,​<a class="ref" id="ref5" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/2*.html#note5" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">5</a>
 at no greater length than was necessary nor with less clarity than 
I&nbsp;judged you desired. I&nbsp;had next to discuss Proof and 
Refutation, conjointly. Hence I&nbsp;expounded the different Types of 
Issue and their subdivisions,​<a class="ref" id="ref6" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/2*.html#note6" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">6</a> and this at the same time showed


<a id="p61"><span class="pagenum">&nbsp;p61&nbsp;</span></a>how the Type
 of Issue and its subdivision are to be found in a given cause. Then 
I&nbsp;explained how the Point to Adjudicate is properly sought; this 
found, we must see that the complete economy of the entire speech is 
directed to it.​<a class="ref" id="ref7" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/2*.html#note7" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">7</a> After that I&nbsp;remarked that there are not a&nbsp;few causes​<a class="ref" id="ref8" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/2*.html#note8" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">8</a> to which several Types of Issue or their subdivisions are applicable.

	</p><p class="justify">
	<a class="chapter" name="R2">2</a>
It remained for me, as it seemed, to show by what method we can adapt 
the means of invention to each type of issue or its subdivision,​<a class="ref" id="ref9" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/2*.html#note9" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">9</a> and likewise what sort of technical arguments (which the Greeks call <span class="translit_Greek">epicheiremata</span>)​<a class="ref" id="ref10" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/2*.html#note10" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">10</a> one ought to seek​<a class="ref" id="ref11" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/2*.html#note11" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">11</a> or avoid;​<a class="ref" id="ref12" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/2*.html#note12" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">12</a>
 both of these departments belong to Proof and Refutation. Then finally 
I&nbsp;have explained what kind of Conclusions to speeches one ought to 
employ;​<a class="ref" id="ref13" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/2*.html#note13" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">13</a> the Conclusion was the last of the six parts of a discourse.

	</p><p class="justify">
First, then, I&nbsp;shall investigate how we should handle causes 
representing each Type of Issue, and of course shall give primary 
consideration to that type which is the most important and most 
difficult.

	</p><p class="justify">
<a class="sec" name="3">3</a>&nbsp;In a Conjectural cause the 
prosecutor's Statement of Facts should contain, intermingled and 
interspersed in it, material inciting suspicion of the defendant, so 
that no act, no word, no coming or going, in short nothing that he has 
done may be thought to lack a motive. The Statement of Facts of the 
defendant's counsel should contain a simple and clear statement, and 
should also weaken suspicion.

	</p><p class="justify" id="p63"><span class="pagenum">&nbsp;p63&nbsp;</span>
The scheme of the Conjectural Issue includes six divisions: Probability,
 Comparison, Sign, Presumptive Proof, Subsequent Behaviour, and 
Confirmatory Proof. I&nbsp;shall explain the meaning of each of these 
terms.

	</p><p class="justify" id="Probability">
Through Probability​<a class="ref" id="ref14" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/2*.html#note14" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">14</a>
 one proves that the crime was profitable to the defendant, and that he 
has never abstained from this kind of foul practice. The subheads under 
Probability are Motive and Manner of Life.<a class="ref" id="ref15" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/2*.html#note15" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">15</a>

	</p><p class="justify" id="Motive">
The Motive​<a class="ref" id="ref16" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/2*.html#note16" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">16</a> is what led the defendant to commit the crime, through the hope it gave him of winning advantages or avoiding disadvantages.​<a class="ref" id="ref17" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/2*.html#note17" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">17</a>
 The question is: Did he seek some benefit from the crime — honour, 
money, or power? Did he wish to satisfy some passion — love or a like <span class="whole">over­powering</span> desire? Or did he seek to avoid some disadvantage — enmities, ill repute, pain, or punishment? <a class="chapter" name="R3">3</a>&nbsp;<a class="sec" name="4">4</a>&nbsp;Here
 the prosecutor, if the hope of gaining an advantage is in question, 
will disclose his opponent's passion; if the avoidance of a disadvantage
 is in question, he will enlarge upon his opponent's fear. The 
defendant's counsel, on the other hand, will, if possible, deny that 
there was a motive, or will at least vigorously belittle its importance;
 then he will say that it is unfair to bring under suspicion of 
wrongdoing every one to whom some profit has come from an act.

	</p><p class="justify" id="p65"><span class="pagenum">&nbsp;p65&nbsp;</span>
	<a id="Manner_of_Life"></a>
<a class="sec" name="5">5</a>&nbsp;Next the defendant's Manner of Life 
will be examined in the light of his previous conduct. First the 
prosecutor will consider whether the accused has ever committed a 
similar offence.​<a class="ref" id="ref18" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/2*.html#note18" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">18</a>
 If he does not find any, he will seek to learn whether the accused has 
ever incurred the suspicion of any similar guilt; and it will devolve 
upon him to make every effort to relate the defendant's manner of life 
to the motive which he has just exposed. For example, if the prosecutor 
contends that the motive for the crime was money, let him show that the 
defendant has always been covetous; if the motive was public honour, 
ambitious; he will thus be able to link the flaw in the defendant's 
character with the motive for the crime. If he cannot find a flaw 
consistent with the motive, let him find one that is not. If he cannot 
show that the defendant is covetous,​<a class="ref" id="ref19" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/2*.html#note19" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">19</a>
 let him show that he is a treacherous seducer; in short, if he possibly
 can, let him brand the defendant with the stigma of some one fault, or 
indeed, of as many faults as possible.​<a class="ref" id="ref20" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/2*.html#note20" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">20</a>
 Then, he will say, it is no wonder that the man who in that other 
instance acted so basely should have acted so criminally in this 
instance too.​<a class="ref" id="ref21" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/2*.html#note21" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">21</a>
 If the adversary enjoys a high reputation for purity and integrity, the
 prosecutor will say that deeds, not reputation, ought to be considered;
 that the defendant has previously concealed his misdeeds,​<a class="ref" id="ref22" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/2*.html#note22" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">22</a>
 and he will make it plain that the defendant is not guiltless of 
misbehaviour. The defendant's counsel will first show his client's 
upright life,​<a class="ref" id="ref23" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/2*.html#note23" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">23</a>
 if he can; if he cannot, he will have recourse to thoughtlessness, 
folly, youth, force, or undue influence. On these matters 
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. censure ought not to be imposed for conduct extraneous 
to the present charge. If the speaker is seriously


<a id="p67"><span class="pagenum">&nbsp;p67&nbsp;</span></a>handicapped 
by the man's baseness and notoriety, he will first take care to say that
 false rumours have been spread about an innocent man, and will use the 
commonplace that rumour ought not to be believed. If none of these pleas
 is practicable, let him use the last resource of defence; let him say 
that he is not discussing the man's morals before censors, but the 
charges of his opponents before jurors.<a class="ref" id="ref24" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/2*.html#note24" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">24</a>

	</p><p class="justify">
	<a class="chapter" name="R4">4</a>
	<a id="Comparison"></a>
<a class="sec" name="6">6</a>&nbsp;Comparison​<a class="ref" id="ref25" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/2*.html#note25" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">25</a>
 is used when the prosecutor shows that the act charged by him against 
his adversary has benefited no one but the defendant; or that no one but
 his adversary could have committed it; or that the adversary could not 
have committed it, or at least not so easily, by other means; or that, 
blinded by passion, his adversary failed to see any easier means. To 
meet this point the defendant's counsel ought to show that the crime 
benefited others as well, or that others as well could have done what is
 imputed to his client.

	</p><p class="justify" id="Sign">
By Signs one shows that the accused sought an opportunity favourable to success. Sign​<a class="ref" id="ref26" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/2*.html#note26" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">26</a>
 has six divisions: the Place, the Point of Time, the Duration of Time, 
the Occasion, the Hope of Success, the Hope of Escaping Detection.

	</p><p class="justify" id="Place">
<a class="sec" name="7">7</a>&nbsp;The Place is examined as follows: Was
 it frequented or deserted, always a lonely place, or deserted then at 
the moment of the crime? A&nbsp;sacred place or profane, public or 
private? What sort of places are adjacent? Could the victim have been 
seen or heard? I&nbsp;should willingly describe in detail


<a id="p69"><span class="pagenum">&nbsp;p69&nbsp;</span></a>which of 
these points is serviceable to the defence, and which to the 
prosecution, were it not that any one would in a given cause find this 
easy to determine. For of Invention it is only the first principles 
which ought to originate in theory; all the rest will readily be 
supplied by practice.

	</p><p class="justify" id="Point_of_Time">
The Point of Time is examined as follows: In what season of the year, in
 what part of the day — whether at night or in the daytime — at what 
hour of the day​<a class="ref" id="ref27" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/2*.html#note27" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">27</a> or night, is the act alleged to have been committed, and why at such a time?

	</p><p class="justify" id="Duration_of_Time">
The Duration of Time will be considered in the following fashion: Was it
 long enough to carry this act through, and did the defendant know that 
there would be enough time to accomplish it? For it is only of slight 
importance that he had enough time to carry out the crime if he could 
not in advance have known or have forecast that that would be so.

	</p><p class="justify" id="Occasion">
The Occasion is examined as follows: Was it favourable for the 
undertaking, or was there a better occasion which was either let pass or
 not awaited?

	</p><p class="justify" id="Hope_of_Success">
Whether there was any Hope of Success will be investigated as follows: Do the <span class="whole">above-mentioned</span>
 signs coincide? Especially, do power, money, good judgement, 
foreknowledge, and preparedness appear on one side, and is it proved 
that on the other there were weakness, need, stupidity, lack of 
foresight, and unpreparedness? Hereby one will know whether the 
defendant should have had confidence in his success or not.

	</p><p class="justify" id="Hope_of_Escaping_Detection">
What Hope there was of Escaping Detection we seek to learn from confidants, <span class="whole">eye-witnesses</span>, or accomplices, freemen or slaves or both.<a class="ref" id="ref28" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/2*.html#note28" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">28</a>

	</p><p class="justify" id="p71"><span class="pagenum">&nbsp;p71&nbsp;</span>
	<a id="Presumptive_Proof"></a>
	<a class="chapter" name="R5">5</a>
<a class="sec" name="8">8</a>&nbsp;Through Presumptive Proof guilt is 
demonstrated by means of indications that increase certainty and 
strengthen suspicion. It falls into three periods: preceding the crime, 
contemporaneous with the crime, following the crime.<a class="ref" id="ref29" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/2*.html#note29" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">29</a>

	</p><p class="justify">
In respect to the period preceding the crime, one ought to consider 
where the defendant was, where he was seen, whether he made some 
preparation, met any one, said anything, or showed any sign of having 
confidants, accomplices, or means of assistance; whether he was in a 
place, or there at a time, at variance with his custom. In respect to 
the period contemporaneous with the crime, we shall seek to learn 
whether he was seen in the act; whether some noise, outcry, or crash was
 heard; or, in short, whether anything was perceived by one of the 
senses — sight, hearing, touch, smell, or taste. In respect to the 
period following the crime, one will seek to discover whether after the

 the accused was discovered;

 The prosecutor will, if possible, say that his adversary, when come 
upon, blushed, paled, faltered, spoke uncertainly, collapsed, or made 
some offer — signs of a guilty conscience. If the accused has done none 
of these things, the prosecutor will say his adversary had even so far 
in advance calculated what would actually happen to him that he stood 
his ground and replied with the greatest <span class="whole">self-assurance</span> — signs of audacity, and not of innocence.

 we shall speak under the heads: (a)&nbsp;authority and manner of life 
of the witnesses, and (b)&nbsp;the consistency of their evidence. 
Against witnesses, under the heads: (a)&nbsp;their base manner of 
living; (b)&nbsp;the contradictory character of their testimony; 
(c)&nbsp;if we contend that what they allege to have happened either 
could not have happened or did not happen, or that they could not have 
known it, or that it is partiality which inspires their words and 
inferences. These topics will appertain both to the discrediting and to 
the examination of witnesses.

<a class="sec" name="10">10</a>&nbsp;We shall speak in favour of the testimony given under torture​<a class="ref" id="ref37" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/2*.html#note37" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">37</a>
 when we show that it was in order to discover the truth that our 
ancestors wished investigations to make use of torture and the rack, and
 that men are compelled by violent pain to tell all they know. Moreover,
 such reasoning will have


<a id="p77"><span class="pagenum">&nbsp;p77&nbsp;</span></a>the greater 
force if we give the confessions elicited under torture an appearance of
 plausibility by the same argumentative procedure as is used in treating
 any question of fact. And this, too, we shall have to do with the 
evidence of witnesses. Against the testimony given under torture we 
shall speak as follows: In the first place, our ancestors wished 
inquisitions to be introduced only in connection with unambiguous 
matters, when the true statement in the inquisition could be recognized 
and the false reply refuted; for example, if they sought to learn in 
what place some object was put, or if there was in question something 
like that which could be seen, or be verified by means of footprints, or
 be perceived by some like sign. We then shall say that pain ought not 
to be relied upon, because one person is less exhausted by pain, or more
 <span class="whole">resource</span>­ful in fabrication, than another, 
and also because it is often possible to know or divine what the 
presiding justice wishes to hear, and the witness knows that when he has
 said this his pain will be at an end. Such reasoning will find favour, 
if, by a plausible argument, we refute the statements made in the 
testimony given under torture; and to accomplish this we should use the 
divisions under the Conjectural Issue which I&nbsp;have set forth above.<a class="ref" id="ref38" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/2*.html#note38" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">38</a>

<a class="sec" name="11">11</a>&nbsp;In favour of presumptive proof, 
signs, and the other means of increasing suspicion it is advantageous to
 speak as follows: When there is a concurrence of many circumstantial 
indications and signs that agree with one another, the result ought to 
appear as clear fact, not surmise. Again, signs and presumptive proof 
deserve more credence than witnesses, for these first are presented 
precisely as they occurred in


<a id="p79"><span class="pagenum">&nbsp;p79&nbsp;</span></a>reality, whereas witnesses can be corrupted by bribery, or partiality, or intimation, or animosity.​<a class="ref" id="ref39" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/2*.html#note39" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">39</a>
 Against presumptive proof, signs, and the other provocatives of 
suspicion we shall speak in the following fashion: we shall show that 
nothing is safe from attack by suspicion, and then we shall weaken each 
and every reason for suspicion and try to show that it applies to us no 
more than to any one else; it is a shameful outrage to consider 
suspicion and conjecture, in the absence of witnesses, as sufficiently 
corroborative.

<a class="sec" name="12">12</a>&nbsp;We shall speak in favour of rumour 
by saying that a report is not wont to be created recklessly and without
 some foundation, and that there was no reason for anybody wholly to 
invent and fabricate one; and, moreover, if other rumours usually are 
lies, we shall prove by argument that this one is true. We shall speak 
against rumours if we first show that many rumours are false, and cite 
examples of false report; if we say that the rumours were the invention 
of our enemies or of other men malicious and slanderous by nature; and 
if we either present some story invented against our adversaries which 
we declare to be in every mouth, or produce a true report carrying some 
disgrace to them, and say we yet have no faith in it for the reason that
 any person at all can produce and spread any disgraceful rumour or 
fiction about any other person. If, nevertheless, a rumour seems highly 
plausible, we can destroy its authority by logical argument.

Because the Conjectural Issue is the hardest to treat and in actual causes​<a class="ref" id="ref40" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/2*.html#note40" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">40</a>
 needs to be treated most often, I&nbsp;have the more carefully examined
 all its divisions, in order that we may not be hindered by even the 
slightest hesitation or blunder, if only we have applied these precepts 
of theory in assiduous practice. Now let me turn to the subtypes of 
Legal Issue.

	</p><p class="justify">
	<a class="chapter" name="R9">9</a>
<a class="sec" name="13">13</a>&nbsp;When the intention of the framer appears at variance with the letter of a text, speaking in support of the letter​<a class="ref" id="ref41" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/2*.html#note41" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">41</a>
 we shall employ the following topics: first, after the Statement of 
Facts, a eulogy of the framer and then the reading aloud of the text; 
next the questioning of our adversaries: Are they duly aware that this 
text was in a law, will, contract, or any other document involved in the
 cause?; then a comparison of the text with the admitted act of our 
adversaries: Which should the judge follow — a&nbsp;document carefully 
draughted, or an interpretation cunningly invented? After that the 
interpretation devised and given to the text by our adversaries will be 
disparaged and weakened. Then the question will be raised: What risk 
would the writer have run by adding an entry of that kind had he really 
intended it, or was it impossible to write it out in full? Then we shall
 ascertain the writer's situation and present the reason why he had in 
mind what he wrote, and show that that text is clear, concise, apt, 
complete, and planned with precision. Thereupon we shall cite examples 
of judgements rendered in favour of the text, although adversaries 
raised the issue of spirit and intention. Finally, we shall show the 
danger of departing from the letter of the text. The commonplace here is
 that against one who, though confessing


<a id="p83"><span class="pagenum">&nbsp;p83&nbsp;</span></a>that he has violated the mandates of a statute or the directions of a will, yet seeks to defend his act.

	</p><p class="justify">
	<a class="chapter" name="R10">10</a>
<a class="sec" name="14">14</a>&nbsp;In favour of the intention we shall
 speak as follows: first we shall praise the framer for deft conciseness
 in having written only what was necessary; he did not think it 
necessary to write what could be understood without a text. Next we 
shall say that to follow the words literally and to neglect the 
intention is the method of a pettifogger.​<a class="ref" id="ref42" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/2*.html#note42" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">42</a>
 Then, we shall contend, the letter either cannot be carried out, or at 
least not without violation of Statute Law, Legal Custom, the Law of 
Nature, or Equity​<a class="ref" id="ref43" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/2*.html#note43" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">43</a>
 — all these, as no one will deny, the writer wished to be most strictly
 observed; but on the contrary, what we have done is absolutely just. 
Further, the interpretation of our adversaries is either no 
interpretation, or is unreasonable, unjust, impracticable, or 
inconsistent with past or subsequent interpretations, or is in 
disagreement with the common law​<a class="ref" id="ref44" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/2*.html#note44" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">44</a>
 or with other generally binding rules of law or with previous 
decisions. Next we shall cite instances of decisions rendered in favour 
of the intention and contrary to the letter, and then


<a id="p85"><span class="pagenum">&nbsp;p85&nbsp;</span></a>read and 
explain laws or contracts which had been written down in concise form 
and yet in which the intention of the framer is understood. The 
commonplace here is that against one who reads a text and does not 
interpret the writer's intention.

	</p><p class="justify">
<a class="sec" name="15">15</a>&nbsp;When two laws conflict, we must 
first see whether they have been superseded or restricted, and then 
whether their disagreement is such that one commands and the other 
prohibits, or one compels and the other allows. It will be a weak 
defence indeed for a person to say that he failed to do what one law 
ordained, because another law made it optional; for obligation is more 
binding than mere permission. So also it is a meagre defence for a 
person to show that he has observed the obligation of a law which has 
been superseded or restricted, without heeding the obligation of the 
later law. After these considerations we shall at once pass to the 
exposition, reading, and warm recommendation of the law favourable to 
us. Then we shall elucidate the intention of the opposing law and 
appropriate it for the advantage of our cause. Finally, we shall take 
over the theory of Law from the Absolute Juridical Issue, and examine 
with which side the departments of Law hold; this subtype of a Juridical
 Issue I&nbsp;shall discuss later.<a class="ref" id="ref45" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/2*.html#note45" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">45</a>

<a class="sec" name="16">16</a>&nbsp;If a text is regarded as ambiguous,
 because it can be interpreted in two or more meanings, the treatment is
 as follows: first we must examine whether it is indeed ambiguous; then 
we must show how it would have been written if the writer had wished it 
to have the meaning which our adversaries give to it; next, that our 
interpretation is practicable, and practicable in conformity with the 
Honourable and the Right, with Statute Law, Legal Custom,


<a id="p87"><span class="pagenum">&nbsp;p87&nbsp;</span></a>the Law of Nature, or Equity;​<a class="ref" id="ref46" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/2*.html#note46" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">46</a>
 of our adversaries' interpretation the opposite is true; and the text 
is not ambiguous since one well understands which is the true sense. 
There are some who think that for the development of this kind of cause a
 knowledge of amphibolies as taught by the dialecticians is highly 
useful. I,&nbsp;however, believe that this knowledge is of no help at 
all, and is, I&nbsp;may even say, a most serious hindrance. In fact 
these writers are on the lookout for all amphibolies, even for such as 
yield no sense at all in one of the two interpretations. Accordingly, 
when some one else speaks, they are his annoying hecklers, and when he 
writes, they are his boring and also misty interpreters. And when they 
themselves speak, wishing to do so cautiously and deftly, they prove to 
be utterly inarticulate. Thus, in their fear to utter some ambiguity 
while speaking, they cannot even pronounce their own names. Indeed 
I&nbsp;shall refute the childish opinions of these writers by the most 
straightforward proofs whenever you wish. For the present it has not 
been out of place to make this protest, in order to express my contempt 
for the wordy learning of this school of inarticulateness.<a class="ref" id="ref47" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/2*.html#note47" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">47</a>

<a class="sec" name="17">17</a>&nbsp;When we deal with the Issue of 
Definition, we shall first briefly define the term in question, as 
follows: "He impairs the sovereign majesty of the state who destroys the
 elements constituting its dignity. What are these, Quintus Caepio? The


<a id="p89"><span class="pagenum">&nbsp;p89&nbsp;</span></a>suffrage of 
the people and the counsel of the magistracy. No doubt, then, in 
demolishing the bridges of the Comitium, you have deprived the people of
 their suffrage and the magistracy of their counselling."​<a class="ref" id="ref48" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/2*.html#note48" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">48</a>
 Likewise, in reply: "He impairs the sovereign majesty of the state who 
inflicts damage upon its dignity. I&nbsp;have not inflicted, but rather 
prevented, damage, for I&nbsp;have saved the Treasury, resisted the 
licence of wicked men, and kept the majesty of the state from perishing 
utterly." Thus the meaning of the term is first explained briefly, and 
adapted to the advantage of our cause; then we shall connect our conduct
 with the explanation of the term; finally, the principle underlying the
 contrary definition will be refuted, as being false, inexpedient, 
disgraceful, or harmful — and here we shall borrow our means from the 
departments of Law treated under the Absolute Juridical Issue, which 
I&nbsp;shall soon discuss.<a class="ref" id="ref49" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/2*.html#note49" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">49</a>

 matter is in fact like or unlike the matter in question; then whether

cause is given, when we know the departments of which the Law is 
constituted. The constituent departments, then, are the following: 
Nature, Statute, Custom, Previous Judgements, Equity, and Agreement.<a class="ref" id="ref54" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/2*.html#note54" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">54</a>

 is that which, in the absence of any statute, is by usage endowed with

 another; and it often happens that on the very same matter one has

contract on the matter, party shall plead; if they do not have contract,
 party shall state outline of cause in the Comitium or the Forum before 
midday."​<a class="ref" id="ref68" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/2*.html#note68" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">68</a> There are also agreements which, independently of statutes,

 Next we ought to discover whether the defendant himself should have

determine this belonged to others. Then the prosecutor, in accordance

The Acknowledgement includes the Exculpation and the Plea for Mercy.

	</p><p class="justify" id="p101"><span class="pagenum">&nbsp;p101&nbsp;</span>
The Exculpation is our denial that we acted with intent. Subheads under 
Plea of Exculpation are Necessity, Accident, and Ignorance. These are to
 be explained first, and then, as it seems, it will be best to return to
 the Plea for Mercy. One must first consider whether it was the 
defendant's fault that he was brought to this necessity.​<a class="ref" id="ref76" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/2*.html#note76" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">76</a>
 After that we must inquire what means he had to avoid or lighten this 
superior force. Next, did he who offers necessity as an excuse try to 
do, or to contrive, what he could against it? Then, cannot some grounds 
for suspicion be drawn from the procedure in a conjectural issue, which 
would signify that the deed attributed to necessity was premeditated? 
Finally, if there was some extreme necessity, is it proper to deem this a
 sufficient excuse?

	</p><p class="justify">
<a class="sec" name="24">24</a>&nbsp;If the defendant says that he erred through ignorance,​<a class="ref" id="ref77" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/2*.html#note77" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">77</a>
 the first question will be: Could he or could he not have been 
uninformed? Next, did he or did he not make an effort to inform himself?
 Then, is his ignorance attributable to accident or to his own fault? 
For a person who declares that his reason fled because of wine or love 
or anger, will appear to have lacked comprehension through fault of 
character rather than ignorance;​<a class="ref" id="ref78" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/2*.html#note78" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">78</a> he will therefore not justify himself on the ground of ignorance, but will taint himself with guilt.​<a class="ref" id="ref79" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/2*.html#note79" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">79</a>
 Finally, by means of the procedure in a conjectural issue, we shall 
seek to discover whether he was or was not informed, and consider 
whether ignorance should be sufficient justification when it is 
established that the deed was committed.

	</p><p class="justify" id="p103"><span class="pagenum">&nbsp;p103&nbsp;</span>
When the cause of the crime is attributed to accident,​<a class="ref" id="ref80" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/2*.html#note80" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">80</a>
 and counsel for the defence maintains that his client should be 
pardoned on that ground, it appears that all the points to be considered
 are precisely those prescribed above for necessity; for all these three
 divisions of Exculpation are so closely interrelated that virtually the
 same rules can be applied to them all.

 when we confess the crime without attributing it to ignorance, chance, 
or necessity, and yet beg for pardon. Here the ground for pardoning is 
sought in the following topics: if it seems evident that the good deeds 
of the suppliant have been more numerous or more weighty than the bad; 
if he is endowed with some virtue, or with good birth; if there is any 
hope that he will be of service in the event that he departs unpunished;
 if the suppliant himself is shown to have been gentle and 
compassionate​<a class="ref" id="ref84" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/2*.html#note84" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">84</a>
 in power; if in committing his mistakes he was moved not by hatred or 
cruelty, but by a sense of duty and right endeavour; if on a similar 
ground others also have been pardoned; if, in the event that we acquit 
him, no peril from him appears likely to be our lot in


<a id="p105"><span class="pagenum">&nbsp;p105&nbsp;</span></a>the future; if as a result of that acquittal no censure will accrue either from our <span class="whole">fellow-citizens</span> or from some other state. <a class="sec" name="26">26</a>&nbsp;Commonplaces:
 on humanity, fortune, pity, and the mutability of things. All these 
commonplaces, reversed, will be used by the adversary, what will also 
amplify and recount the defendant's transgressions. Such a cause is not 
admissible in the courts, as I&nbsp;showed in Book&nbsp;I,​<a class="ref" id="ref85" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/2*.html#note85" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">85</a> but because it is admissible either before the Senate or a council, I&nbsp;have decided that I&nbsp;should not pass it over.

 If upon a person, we must first examine whether the person to whom the 
responsibility is transferred had as much influence as the defendant 
will represent; next, whether the defendant could somehow have resisted 
this influence honourably or safely;​<a class="ref" id="ref87" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/2*.html#note87" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">87</a>
 and, even if the conditions are in fullest measure such as the 
defendant represents them to be, whether it is nevertheless proper to 
make allowances to him just because he acted on another's persuasion. 
Then we shall turn the controversy into one of fact and examine in 
detail whether there was premeditation. If the responsibility is 
transferred to some circumstance, virtually these same precepts and all 
those that I&nbsp;have set forth on Necessity​<a class="ref" id="ref88" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/2*.html#note88" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">88</a> are to be observed.

<a class="sec" name="27">27</a>&nbsp;Since I&nbsp;believe that 
I&nbsp;have fully shown what arguments are advantageous used in each

 these arguments elegantly and completely. To be sure, it is in general 
not hard to devise matter which should serve to support a cause, but to 
polish what has been devised and to give it a ready delivery is very 
hard. Indeed it is this faculty which keeps us from dwelling longer than
 necessary on the same topics, from returning again and again to the 
same place, abandoning a chain of argument before it has been completed,
 and making an inappropriate transition to the next argument. By the 
following method, therefore, we can ourselves remember what we have said
 in each place, and the hearer can perceive and remember the 
distribution of the parts in the whole cause and also in each particular
 argument.

	</p><p class="justify">
<a class="sec" name="28">28</a>&nbsp;The most complete and perfect 
argument, then, is that which is comprised of five parts: the 
Proposition, the Reason, the Proof of the Reason, the Embellishment, and
 the Résumé.​<a class="ref" id="ref90" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/2*.html#note90" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">90</a> Through the

 we set forth summarily what we intend to prove. The Reason, by means of
 a brief explanation subjoined, sets forth the causal basis for the 
Proposition, establishing the truth of what we are urging. The Proof of 
the Reason corroborates, by means of additional arguments, the briefly 
presented Reason. Embellishment we use in order to adorn and enrich the 
argument, after the Proof has been established. The Résumé is a brief 
conclusion, drawing together the parts of the argument.

	</p><p class="justify">
Hence, to make the most complete use of these five parts, we shall develop an argument as follows:<a class="ref" id="ref92" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/2*.html#note92" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">92</a>

<a id="p111"><span class="pagenum">&nbsp;p111&nbsp;</span></a>encouraged him to slay the man from whom he dreaded vengeance, and, in addition, the habit of <span class="whole">wrong-doing</span> robbed him of his scruples at undertaking the evil deed.​<a class="ref" id="ref96" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/2*.html#note96" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">96</a>

enemy to stay alive. To whom, pray, will this seem strange? For when we 
see wild beasts rush eagerly and resolutely to attack one another, we 
must not think it incredible that this creature, too — a&nbsp;wild, 
cruel, inhuman spirit — set out passionately to destroy his enemy; 
especially since in beasts we see no reasoning, good or bad, while he, 
we know, always had designs, ever so many, and ever so base."​<a class="ref" id="ref97" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/2*.html#note97" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">97</a>

An argument comprised of the five parts is, then, the most complete, but
 its use is not always necessary. There is a time when the Résumé should
 be dispensed with — if the matter is brief enough to be readily 
embraced by the memory. There is a situation, too, in which the 
Embellishment should be omitted — if the matter proves to be too meagre 
for amplification and adornment. And if the argument is brief and the 
matter also slight or insignificant, then both the Embellishment and the
 Résumé should be left out. This rule which I&nbsp;have just set forth 
is to be observed for the last two parts in every argument.​<a class="ref" id="ref99" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/2*.html#note99" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">99</a>
 The fullest argument, therefore, is fivefold, the briefest threefold, 
and the mean fourfold, lacking either the Embellishment or the Résumé.

 a double advantage. It will warn us to avoid a fault in arguing, and 
teach us skilfully to reprehend a fault not avoided by others.

	</p><p class="justify">
Since, then, I&nbsp;have shown that a perfect and full argument consists of five parts,​<a class="ref" id="ref102" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/2*.html#note102" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">102</a> let us consider the


<a id="p115"><span class="pagenum">&nbsp;p115&nbsp;</span></a>faults to 
be avoided in each single part of the argument, so that we may ourselves
 be able to shun these faults, and by the following rules test the 
argument of our adversaries in all its parts and undermine it in some 
one of these.

	</p><p class="justify">
<a class="sec" name="32">32</a>&nbsp;The Proposition is defective when 
an assertion based on some one part or on a majority of individuals, but
 not necessarily applicable to all, is referred to all, as if one should
 argue as follows: "All the poor would rather do wrong and acquire 
riches than do right and remain poor." If a speaker has presented this 
sort of Proposition in an argument, without caring to ask of what nature
 the Reason or the Proof of the Reason is to be, we shall easily refute 
his Proposition by showing that what is true of one dishonest poor man 
is being falsely and unjustly applied to all the poor.<a class="ref" id="ref103" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/2*.html#note103" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">103</a>

	</p><p class="justify">
<a class="sec" name="33">33</a>&nbsp;Again, the Proposition is defective
 when a rare occurrence is declared to be absolutely impossible, as 
follows: "No one can fall in love at a single glance, or as he is 
passing by."​<a class="ref" id="ref104" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/2*.html#note104" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">104</a>
 For inasmuch as some have fallen in love at first sight, and yet the 
speaker has said "no&nbsp;one," it is of no significance whatsoever that
 the experience occurs but rarely, provided we understand that it 
sometimes does occur, or even only that it can occur.

	</p><p class="justify">
	<a class="chapter" name="R21">21</a>
Again, the Proposition is defective when we submit that we have made a 
complete enumeration of the possibilities and pass by some pertinent 
one,​<a class="ref" id="ref105" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/2*.html#note105" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">105</a>
 as follows: "Since, then, it is established that the man was killed, he
 must have been killed by robbers, or by enemies, or by you, whom in his
 will he made


<a id="p117"><span class="pagenum">&nbsp;p117&nbsp;</span></a>part-heir.
 In that place robbers have never been seen. He had no enemy. If he was 
not killed by robbers, of whom there were none, nor by enemies, of whom 
he had none, it remains that he was slain by you." We shall refute a 
Proposition of this type by showing that others besides those whom the 
speaker has enumerated could have undertaken the crime.​<a class="ref" id="ref106" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/2*.html#note106" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">106</a>
 Here, for example, when he has said that the murder must have been 
committed by robbers, or by enemies, or by us, we shall say that it 
could have been committed by the man's slaves or by our co‑heirs. When 
we have in this way upset the enumeration made by our accusers, we have 
left ourselves wider room for defence. This then is another mistake 
always to be avoided in the Proposition — the omission of some pertinent
 item when we think that we have included all.

	</p><p class="justify">
<a class="sec" name="34">34</a>&nbsp;Again, the Proposition is defective
 if it is based on a false enumeration and we present fewer 
possibilities than there are in reality, as follows: "There are two 
things, men of the jury, which ever impel men to crime: luxury and 
greed."​<a class="ref" id="ref107" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/2*.html#note107" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">107</a> "But what about love?," some one will say, "ambition,​<a class="ref" id="ref108" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/2*.html#note108" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">108</a> superstition, the fear of death,​<a class="ref" id="ref109" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/2*.html#note109" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">109</a> the passion for power, and, in short,

multitude of other motives?" Again the enumeration is false when the 
possibilities are fewer than we present, as follows: "There are three 
emotions that agitate all men: fear, desire, and worry." Indeed it had 
been enough to say fear and desire, since worry is necessarily conjoined
 with both.

Again, the Proposition is defective if it traces things too far back, as
 follows: "Stupidity is the mother and matter of all evils. She gives 
birth to boundless desires. Furthermore, boundless desires have neither 
end nor limit. They breed avarice. Avarice, further, drives men to any 
crime you will. Thus it is avarice which has led our adversaries to take
 this crime upon themselves."​<a class="ref" id="ref110" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/2*.html#note110" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">110</a>
 Here what was said last was enough for a Proposition, lest we copy 
Ennius and the other poets, who are licensed to speak as follows: 
"O&nbsp;that in Pelion's woods the firwood timbers had not fallen to the
 ground, cut down by axes, and that therefrom had not commenced the 
undertaking to begin the ship which now is named with the name of Argo, 
because in it sailed the picked Argive heroes who were seeking the 
golden fleece of the ram from the Colchians, with guile, at King Pelias'
 command. For then never would my mistress, misled, have set foot away 
from home."​<a class="ref" id="ref111" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/2*.html#note111" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">111</a> Indeed here


<a id="p121"><span class="pagenum">&nbsp;p121&nbsp;</span></a>it were 
adequate, if poets had a care for mere adequacy, to say: "Would that my 
misled mistress had not set foot away from home." In the Proposition, 
then, we must also carefully guard against this tra­cing of things back 
to their remotest origin; for the Proposition does not, like many 
others, need to be refuted, but is on its own account defective.<a class="ref" id="ref112" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/2*.html#note112" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">112</a>

<a class="sec" name="35">35</a>&nbsp;The Reason is defective if it is 
inappropriate to the Proposition because either weak or groundless. It 
is weak when it does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the
 Proposition, as in Plautus: "To reprove a friend for a fault that 
deserves reproof is a thankless task, but in season useful and 
profitable." That is the Proposition. Let us see what Reason is 
presented: "For​<a class="ref" id="ref113" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/2*.html#note113" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">113</a>
 today I&nbsp;shall severely reprove my friend for a fault that much 
deserves reproof." His reckoning of what is useful is based on what he 
himself is about to do, and not on what it is proper to do. 
A&nbsp;Reason is groundless when it rests on a false supposition, as 
follows: "One must not flee from love, for it engenders the truest 
friendship."​<a class="ref" id="ref114" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/2*.html#note114" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">114</a> Or as follows: "One must spurn philosophy, for it

	</p><p class="justify">
<a class="sec" name="36">36</a>&nbsp;Again, a Reason is weak if the 
causal basis which it submits for the Proposition is not a compelling 
one. For example, Pacuvius: "The goddess Fortune is mad, blind, and 
stupid, some philosophers maintain. They declare that she stands upon a 
revolving globe of stone;​<a class="ref" id="ref116" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/2*.html#note116" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">116</a>
 whither Chance impels the stone, thither, they say, does Fortune fall. 
She is blind, they repeat, for that she fails wholly to perceive whereto
 she attaches herself. Moreover they declare that she is mad because she
 is cruel, uncertain, and inconstant; stupid because she knows not how 
to tell worthy from unworthy. But there are other philosophers who, on 
the contrary, deny that in our wretched life there any such thing as 
Fortune; there is, they say, Blind Accident. That this is more like the 
truth, is proved by the actual experience of life; even as Orestes now 
was king, and now became a beggar. Surely by the shipwreck of his 
property was this brought to pass, and did not befall by Chance or 
Fortune."​<a class="ref" id="ref117" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/2*.html#note117" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">117</a>
 Pacuvius here uses a weak Reason when they say that it is truer to 
ascribe the guidance of events to Accident rather than to Fortune, for 
whichever of these philosophical theories


<a id="p125"><span class="pagenum">&nbsp;p125&nbsp;</span></a>you hold, it could have happened that one who had been a king became a beggar.

	</p><p class="justify">
	<a class="chapter" name="R24">24</a>
<a class="sec" name="37">37</a>&nbsp;Again, a Reason is weak when it 
appears to be presented as the Reason, but says precisely the same as 
was said in the Proposition,​<a class="ref" id="ref118" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/2*.html#note118" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">118</a>
 as follows: "A&nbsp;great evil to mankind is greed, for the reason that
 men wrestle with great and many ills on account of the boundless 
passion for money." Here the reason merely repeats in other words what 
has been said in the Proposition.

	</p><p class="justify">
Again, a Reason is weak if the causal basis which it submits for the Proposition is inadequate to the demands of the subject,​<a class="ref" id="ref119" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/2*.html#note119" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">119</a>
 as follows: "Wisdom is useful because the wise have been in the habit 
of cultivating a sense of duty." Or, "It is useful to have true friends,
 for thus you may have persons with whom you can jest." In Reasons of 
this kind the Proposition is supported not by a universal or absolute 
reason, but by a feeble one.

	</p><p class="justify">
Again, the Reason is weak if it can at choice be applied to another Proposition,​<a class="ref" id="ref120" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/2*.html#note120" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">120</a> as in the case of Pacuvius, who presents the same reason for calling Fortune blind as for calling her stupid.<a class="ref" id="ref121" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/2*.html#note121" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">121</a>

<a class="sec" name="38">38</a>&nbsp;In the Proof of the Reason, there 
are many faults to be avoided in our discourse and also to be watched 
for in that of our adversaries. These must be considered the more 
carefully because an accurate Proof of the Reason supplies the most 
cogent support of the whole argument.

	</p><p class="justify" id="p127"><span class="pagenum">&nbsp;p127&nbsp;</span>
Students in the rhetorical schools, therefore, in Proving the Reason, use a Dilemma,​<a class="ref" id="ref122" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/2*.html#note122" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">122</a>
 as follows: "You treat me, father, with undeserved wrong. For if you 
think Cresphontes wicked, why did you give me to him for wife? But if he
 is honourable, why do you force me to leave such a one against his will
 and mine?" Such a Dilemma will either be reversed against the user, or 
be rebutted in a single term.​<a class="ref" id="ref123" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/2*.html#note123" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">123</a>
 Reversed, as follows: "My daughter, I&nbsp;do not treat you with any 
undeserved wrong. If he is honourable, I&nbsp;have given him you in 
marriage; but if he is wicked, I&nbsp;shall by divorce free you from 
your ills." It will be a rebuttal in a single term if one or the other 
alternative is confuted, as follows: "You say: 'For if you think 
Cresphontes wicked, why did you give me to him for wife?' I&nbsp;thought
 him honourable. I&nbsp;erred. Too late I&nbsp;came to know him, and 
knowing him, I&nbsp;fly from him."​<a class="ref" id="ref124" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/2*.html#note124" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">124</a> <a class="chapter" name="R25">25</a>&nbsp;<a class="sec" name="39">39</a>&nbsp;Thus the rebuttal of a dilemma of this type is twofold: the first fuller, the second easier to invent.

	</p><p class="justify" id="p129"><span class="pagenum">&nbsp;p129&nbsp;</span>
<a name="39.2"></a>Again, the Proof of the Reason is faulty when we 
misapply a sign designating a variety of things in such a way as to 
indicate specifically a single thing,​<a class="ref" id="ref125" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/2*.html#note125" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">125</a>

 indications do not of themselves offer definite proof, but if there is 
concurrence of other like indications, such signs increase probability 
not a little.

	</p><p class="justify"><a name="39.4"></a>
Again, there is a fault when that which is directed against the adversary can as well fit some one else or the speaker himself,​<a class="ref" id="ref127" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/2*.html#note127" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">127</a> as follows: "Wretched are they who marry wives."

	</p><p class="justify"><a name="39.7"></a>
Again it is a fault to assume as certain, on the ground that "it is 
universally agreed upon," a thing which is still in dispute, as follows:
 "Ho! Look you, the gods who guide the movements of the beings that 
dwell above and below keep peace among themselves


<a id="p131"><span class="pagenum">&nbsp;p131&nbsp;</span></a>and join in concord."​<a class="ref" id="ref130" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/2*.html#note130" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">130</a> <a name="39.8"></a>Thus
 Thesprotus, as Ennius has presented him, uses this example on his own 
authority, as though he had already demonstrated the fact by reasons 
sufficiently conclusive.

	</p><p class="justify">
<a class="sec" name="40">40</a>&nbsp;Again, that is faulty which appears to be pronounced too late, as it were, and after the matter has been concluded,​<a class="ref" id="ref131" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/2*.html#note131" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">131</a> as follows: "If it had entered my mind, <span class="whole">fellow-citizens</span>,
 I&nbsp;should not have been guilty of allowing the matter to come to 
such a pass, for I&nbsp;should have done this or that; but at the time 
this thought escaped me."

Again, there is a fault when that which stands as a manifest transgression is yet cloaked by some defence,​<a class="ref" id="ref132" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/2*.html#note132" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">132</a>
 as follows: "When all men were seeking you out and you had a most

 for example, if some influential demagogue should in a speech before 
the Assembly say: "It is better to submit to kings than to bad laws." In
 fact, these words, though they may be uttered by way of amplification 
without sinister intent, are nevertheless because of the speaker's 
influence sure to breed a terrible suspicion.

	</p><p class="justify">
<a class="sec" name="41">41</a>&nbsp;Again, it is a fault to use false or general definitions;​<a class="ref" id="ref135" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/2*.html#note135" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">135</a> false, as if one should say that there is no

 general, like that which can be equally well applied to something else,
 as if one should say: "An informer, in short, is worthy of death; for

 by the following reflection: "For if he has a conscience, why should 
you impeach an honourable man? But if he has a shameless character, to 
what avail then would you impeach one who, when he has heard the charge,
 deems it of little account?" <a class="chapter" name="R27">27</a>&nbsp;He

example, if a man accused of having sought a magistracy by bribery 
should say that in the army he had often received military gifts from

Again, it is a fault, when you establish that a crime was committed, to 
believe you are thereby proving that it was committed by a specific 
person, as follows: "It is established that the corpse was disfigured, 
swollen, and discoloured; therefore the man was killed by poison." Then,
 if the speaker concentrates,


<a id="p139"><span class="pagenum">&nbsp;p139&nbsp;</span></a>as many

 for example, if in deciding by a comparison whether it is better for

suppress, or should mention only those disadvantages which are least 
serious.<a class="ref" id="ref149" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/2*.html#note149" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">149</a>

Again, it is a fault in making a comparison to think it necessary to disparage one thing when you praise the other;​<a class="ref" id="ref150" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/2*.html#note150" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">150</a>
 for example, if the question should arise, who are to be held in 
greater honour for services to the Roman republic, the Albensians or the
 Pinnensian Vestini,​<a class="ref" id="ref151" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/2*.html#note151" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">151</a>
 and the speaker should attack one or the other. Indeed it is not 
necessary, if you prefer one, to disparage the other; for you can 
manage, when you have given greater praise to one, to allot some portion
 of praise to the other, so that you may not be thought to have combated
 the truth under influence of partiality.

	</p><p class="justify" id="p141"><span class="pagenum">&nbsp;p141&nbsp;</span>
Again, it is a fault to build upon a name or appellation a dispute which usage can best decide.​<a class="ref" id="ref152" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/2*.html#note152" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">152</a> For example, Sulpicius​<a class="ref" id="ref153" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/2*.html#note153" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">153</a>
 had opposed his veto to the recall of the exiles who had not been 
permitted to plead their cause; later he changed his mind, and proposing
 the same law, said he was offering a different proposal, because he had
 changed the name. For, he said, he was recalling not "exiles," but 
"those ejected by violence" — as though the dispute concerned the name 
by which to call those people, or as though all to whom water and fire 
have been formally forbidden are not called exiles. True, we perhaps 
excuse Sulpicius if he had a reason for doing this.​<a class="ref" id="ref154" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/2*.html#note154" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">154</a> Yet let us understand that it is a fault to raise a controversy on account of a change in names.

	</p><p class="justify">
	<a class="chapter" name="R29">29</a>
<a class="sec" name="46">46</a>&nbsp;Since Embellishment consists of 
similes, examples, amplifications, previous judgements, and the other 
means which serve to expand and enrich the argument, let us consider the
 faults which attach to these.

	</p><p class="justify" id="p143"><span class="pagenum">&nbsp;p143&nbsp;</span>
	<a id="simile.defects"></a>
A&nbsp;Simile is defective if it is inexact in any aspect, and lacks a 
proper ground for the comparison, or is prejudicial to him who presents 
it.<a class="ref" id="ref155" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/2*.html#note155" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">155</a>

	</p><p class="justify" id="example.defects">
An Example is defective if it is either false, and hence refutable, or 
base, and hence not to be imitated, or if it implies more or less than 
the matter demands.<a class="ref" id="ref156" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/2*.html#note156" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">156</a>

	</p><p class="justify" id="previous_judgement.defects">
The citing of a Previous Judgement will be faulty​<a class="ref" id="ref157" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/2*.html#note157" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">157</a>
 if the judgement applies to an unlike matter, or one not in dispute, or
 if it is discreditable, or is of such a kind that previous decisions 
either in greater number or of greater appropriateness can be offered by
 our adversaries.

	</p><p class="justify">
Again, it is a fault, when our adversaries admit a fact, to devote an argument to establishing it as a fact;​<a class="ref" id="ref158" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/2*.html#note158" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">158</a> for it should rather be amplified.

	</p><p class="justify" id="amplification.defects">
Again, it is a fault to amplify what one should prove;​<a class="ref" id="ref159" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/2*.html#note159" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">159</a>
 for example, if a man should charge another with homicide, and before 
he has presented conclusive arguments, should amplify the crime, avowing
 that there is nothing more shameful than homicide. The question is, in 
fact, not whether the deed is or is not shameful, but whether it was 
committed.

	</p><p class="justify" id="resume.defects">
The Résumé is defective if it does not include every point in the exact 
order in which it has been presented; if it does not come to a 
conclusion briefly;​<a class="ref" id="ref160" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/2*.html#note160" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">160</a> and if the summary does not leave something precise and stable, so as to make clear what the Proposition


<a id="p145"><span class="pagenum">&nbsp;p145&nbsp;</span></a>was, then what has been established by the Reason, by the Proof of the Reason, and by the argument as a whole.

	</p><p class="justify">

<a class="sec" name="47">47</a>&nbsp;Conclusions, among the Greeks called <span class="translit_Greek">epilogoi</span>,​<a class="ref" id="ref161" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/2*.html#note161" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">161</a>
 are tripartite, consisting of the Summing Up, Amplification, and Appeal
 to Pity. We can in four places use a Conclusion: in the Direct Opening,
 after the Statement of Facts, after the strongest argument, and in the 
Conclusion of the speech.

	</p><p class="justify" id="summing_up">
The Summing Up​<a class="ref" id="ref162" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/2*.html#note162" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">162</a>
 gathers together and recalls the points we have made — briefly, that 
the speech may not be repeated in entirety, but that the memory of it 
may be refreshed; and we shall reproduce all the points in the order in 
which they have been presented, so that the hearer, if he has committed 
them to memory, is brought back to what he remembers. Again, we must 
take care that the Summary should not be carried back to the 
Introduction or the Statement of Facts. Otherwise the speech will appear
 to


<a id="p147"><span class="pagenum">&nbsp;p147&nbsp;</span></a>have been fabricated​<a class="ref" id="ref163" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/2*.html#note163" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">163</a>
 and devised with elaborate pains so as to demonstrate the speaker's 
skill, advertise his wit, and display his memory. Therefore the Summary 
must take its beginning from the Division. Then we must in order and 
briefly set forth the points treated in the Proof and Refutation.

Amplification is the principle of using Commonplaces to stir​<a class="ref" id="ref164" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/2*.html#note164" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">164</a> the hearers. To amplify an accusation it will be most advantageous to draw commonplaces from ten formulae.

	</p><p class="justify" id="commonplace_1">
<a class="sec" name="48">48</a>&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;The first commonplace​<a class="ref" id="ref165a" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/2*.html#note165" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">165a</a>
 is taken from authority, when we call to mind of what great concern the
 matter under discussion has been to the immortal gods, or to our 
ancestors, or kings, states, barbarous nations, sages, the Senate; and 
again, especially how sanction has been provided in these matters by 
laws.

	</p><p class="justify" id="commonplace_2">
(2)&nbsp;The second commonplace​<a class="ref" id="ref165b" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/2*.html#note165" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">165b</a>
 is used when we consider who are affected by these acts on which our 
charge rest; whether all men, which is a most shocking thing; or our 
superiors, such as are those


<a id="p149"><span class="pagenum">&nbsp;p149&nbsp;</span></a>from whom 
the commonplace of authority is taken; or our peers, those in the same 
situation as we with respect to qualities of character, physical 
attributes, and external circumstances;​<a class="ref" id="ref166" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/2*.html#note166" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">166</a> or our inferiors, whom in all these respects we excel.

 we ask what would happen if the same indulgence should be granted to 
all culprits, and show what perils and disadvantages would ensue from 
indifference to this crime.

	</p><p class="justify" id="commonplace_4">
(4)&nbsp;By means of the fourth commonplace​<a class="ref" id="ref168" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/2*.html#note168" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">168</a>
 we show that if we indulge this man, many others will be the more 
emboldened to commit crimes — something which the anticipation of a 
judicial sentence has hitherto checked.

	</p><p class="justify" id="commonplace_5">
(5)&nbsp;By the fifth commonplace​<a class="ref" id="ref169a" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/2*.html#note169" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">169a</a>
 we show that if once judgement is pronounced otherwise than as we urge,
 there will be nothing which can remedy the harm or correct the jurors' 
error. Here it will be in point for us to make a comparison with other 
mistakes, so as to show that other mistakes can either be moderated by 
time or corrected designedly, but that so far as the present mistake is 
concerned, nothing will serve either to alleviate or to amend it.

	</p><p class="justify" id="commonplace_6">
<a class="sec" name="49">49</a>&nbsp;(6)&nbsp;By means of the sixth commonplace​<a class="ref" id="ref169b" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/2*.html#note169" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">169b</a>
 we show that the act was done with premeditation, and declare that for 
an intentional crime there is no excuse, although a rightful plea of 
mercy is provided for an unpremeditated act.

	</p><p class="justify" id="commonplace_7">
(7)&nbsp;By means of the seventh commonplace​<a class="ref" id="ref169c" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/2*.html#note169" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">169c</a>
 we show it is a foul crime, cruel, sacrilegious, and tyrannical; such a
 crime as the outraging of women, or one of those crimes that incite 
wars and life-and‑death struggles with enemies of the state.

	</p><p class="justify" id="p151"><span class="pagenum">&nbsp;p151&nbsp;</span>
	<a id="commonplace_8"></a>

	</p><p class="justify" id="commonplace_9">
(9)&nbsp;The ninth commonplace consists of comparison​<a class="ref" id="ref171" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/2*.html#note171" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">171</a>
 of wrongs, as when we shall say it is a more heinous crime to debauch a
 free-born person than to steal a sacred object, because the one is done
 from unbridled licentiousness and the other from need.

	</p><p class="justify" id="commonplace_10">
(10)&nbsp;By the tenth commonplace we shall examine sharply, 
incriminatingly, and precisely, everything that took place in the actual
 execution of the deed and all the circumstances that usually attend 
such an act, so that by the enumeration of the attendant circumstances 
the crime may seem to be taking place and the action to unfold before

In the present Book I&nbsp;have treated virtually the most obscure

both with and without me, with care equal to the pains I&nbsp;have taken
 in assembling it, I,&nbsp;on my part, shall reap the fruit of my labour
 in your sharing the knowledge with me, and you, on yours, will praise 
my diligence and rejoice in the learning you have acquired. You will 
have greater understanding of the precepts of rhetoric, and I&nbsp;shall
 be more eager to discharge the rest of my task. But that this will be 
so I&nbsp;know quite well, for I&nbsp;know you well. Let me turn at once

Corresponds to <span lang="el" class="Greek">καλὸν καὶ δίκαιον</span>, <span lang="el" class="Greek">ἐπιεικές</span>, <span lang="el" class="Greek">ἴσον</span>, yet the Roman term emphasizes the social point of view, implying more than "fairness."

 The definition is philosophical, and Greek in origin, but the 
illustration is from Roman law. According to Stroux, "Summum ius summa 
iniuria," the Aristotelian doctrine of equity came to the Roman Forum 
through the Peripatetic and Academic writers, and thence to the <span lang="la" class="Latin">interpretatio iuris</span>, but most students deny such an influence upon the Roman


<a id="p95x"></a>jurists, or minimize it. See Ernst Levy, <i>Sav. Zeitschr.</i> 48&nbsp;(1928), 668‑78; Schiller, <i>Virg. Law Rev.</i> 27.753&nbsp;ff.; Schulz, <i>History of Roman Legal Science</i>, pp74&nbsp;f.

5.14.6</a>) comprised two premises and conclusion; the epicheireme 
normally comprised four premises. Aristotle took the premises for 
granted; the later rhetoricians thought it necessary to prove each. The 
epicheireme may have developed under Stoic influence. Cicero,

<i>De&nbsp;Inv.</i> 1.xxxv.61</a>, makes it clear that the 
quinquepartite epicheireme grew out of Aristotle's syllogism; 
Theophrastus, following observations of Isocrates, may have been the 
first to introduce it into rhetoric. Cicero's syllogistic form (<span lang="la" class="Latin">ratiocinatio</span>) is logical; he treats it on a par with Socratic induction. See

Ulysses hated Palamedes because he had exposed Ulysses' deceit in feigning madness so as to avoid joining the


<a id="p109x"></a>Greek expedition to Troy, and because Ulysses envied 
his fame for wisdom. According to another tradition this hatred arose 
from the severe reproof Palamedes dealt out to Ulysses for returning <span class="whole">empty-handed</span>
 from a foraging expedition. The stories of the vengeance also differ. 
Ulysses and Diomedes induced him to descend into a well in order to find
 alleged treasure, and then stoned him; or they drowned him while he was
 fishing; or with Agamemnon they bribed a servant of Palamedes to 
conceal under Palamedes' bed a forged letter from Priam offering a bribe
 of gold, accused Palamedes of treachery, and when the letter (or gold) 
was discovered, caused him to be stoned by the Greeks.

Most probably for her faithfulness to Rome in the Marsic War, in which 
she gallantly withstood a siege, Alba Fucens, a city of the Aequi on the
 borders of the Marsi in Central Italy, was rewarded with the status of <span lang="la" class="Latin">municipium</span>;
 Pinna (or Penna), at the foot of the Apennines, a chief city of the

In&nbsp;90&nbsp;<span class="small">B.C.</span>, after the outbreak of 
the Marsic War, the tribune L.&nbsp;Varius Hybrida introduced a law on 
treason directed against the senatorial leaders; it inquired into the 
actions of those who helped or advised the allies to take up arms 
against Rome. Sulpicius' law in&nbsp;88 restored the exiles who had been
 condemned without a hearing either by the Varian Commission or by the 
court established under the <span lang="la" class="Latin">Lex


<a id="p141x"></a>Plautia Iudiciaria</span> of&nbsp;90/89, but was 
itself later in the year repealed by Sulla. Why Sulpicius had earlier 
voted against a proposal to recall the exiles is not clear, for many of 
these belonged to his own party. The grounds for the veto were probably 
constitutional, and the new form of the proposal may have been intended 
to avoid constitutional objections that the decisions of the courts were
 being nullified; or perhaps popular opinion pressed him to change his 
mind. It was through the interdiction of fire and water, the symbol of 
the community, that the capital sentence was carried into effect. See

<span lang="el" class="Greek">ἐπίλογοι</span>. The Isocratic theory of 
the Conclusion was also tripartite; to Theodectes (whose rhetorical 
system was based on the parts of the discourse) its functions are to 
stir the emotions, especially anger and pity, to praise or blame, and to
 recall what has been said. See Hugo Rabe, <i>Proleg. Syll.</i>, Leipzig, 1931, pp32 and&nbsp;216; Anon.

Conciliation of the Audience (including the Appeal to Pity), together 
with Discrediting the Opponent. To Aristotle, <i>Rhet.</i>&nbsp;3.19 (1419<span class="small">B</span>),
 the Conclusion has four functions: to conciliate the audience and 
discredit the opponent, to modify and depreciate, to excite the emotions
 required by the case, and to review what has been said. Cicero,
